"""
Board buses F4: the portable microSD model in the QEMU WORKER host.

QEMU asks for each byte's MISO synchronously and cannot wait for the browser,
so a card hosted in the tab always answers too late. The card therefore runs
next to the CPU, as one compiled model
(frontend/src/simulation/buses/models/microsd.c) that every host runs. This
suite is the worker half of the proof; the browser half is

  frontend/src/__tests__/board-buses/board-buses-microsd-model.test.ts

and it drives the same artifact through a real AVR engine and real Arduino
SD.h firmware. Both replay the same table
(frontend/src/__tests__/board-buses/fixtures/microsd-model/sd-script.json),
which is written from the SD spec and not from any runtime, so the two fail
rather than agreeing on a wrong answer.

What this file does NOT prove: that the worker's own fabric picks the right
responder for a chip select, and that a card reaches this runtime at all on the
QEMU path. Those are the worker's wiring, not the model's, and they are
somebody else's file (esp32_worker.py, stm32_worker.py).
