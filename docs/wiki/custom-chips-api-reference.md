# Custom Chips — C API Reference

Complete reference for `velxio-chip.h`. Every function, struct, enum, and
constant the chip can use.

The header is shipped at:

- `backend/sdk/velxio-chip.h` — bundled with the backend Docker image
- `test/test_custom_chips/sdk/include/velxio-chip.h` — local sandbox copy

Both are kept in sync; either works as the include path.

## Lifecycle

```c
void chip_setup(void);
```

Required, exported. Called **once per chip instance** when the simulation
starts. Allocate state, register pins, attach peripherals, and subscribe to
events here. Do not loop.

## Pins

### Types and constants

```c
typedef int32_t vx_pin;          // Opaque handle returned by vx_pin_register
#define VX_INPUT          0
#define VX_OUTPUT         1
#define VX_INPUT_PULLUP   2
#define VX_INPUT_PULLDOWN 3
#define VX_ANALOG         4
#define VX_OUTPUT_LOW     16     // Initialize the wired pin LOW at register time
#define VX_OUTPUT_HIGH    17     // Initialize the wired pin HIGH at register time

#define VX_LOW  0
#define VX_HIGH 1

#define VX_EDGE_RISING  1
#define VX_EDGE_FALLING 2
#define VX_EDGE_BOTH    3
```

Use `VX_OUTPUT_LOW` / `VX_OUTPUT_HIGH` instead of `VX_OUTPUT` when you want
the pin to power up at a known level. This eliminates the brief window
between `vx_pin_register` and your first `vx_pin_write` during which a plain
`VX_OUTPUT` pin would default to LOW.

### `vx_pin_register`

```c
vx_pin vx_pin_register(const char* name, vx_pin_mode mode);
```

Register a logical pin on the chip. `name` is what appears on the schematic
and what the diagram editor uses to wire your chip. Returns an opaque handle
you'll pass to all other pin functions.

Call only from `chip_setup()`.

```c
chip_state_t* s = malloc(sizeof(chip_state_t));
s->in  = vx_pin_register("IN",  VX_INPUT);
s->out = vx_pin_register("OUT", VX_OUTPUT_LOW);   // starts LOW, no glitch
```

### `vx_pin_read`

```c
int vx_pin_read(vx_pin p);
```

Returns the digital state of a pin: `0` (LOW) or `1` (HIGH). On a board pin
it is the level the wire carries: what the MCU drives, or what another part
on the same pin puts there (a button, a tilt switch, a second chip), not the
mode the pin was registered with. A pin nothing has driven yet, or one the
diagram wires to nothing, returns `0`; no host models a chip's own pull on a
board pin.

### `vx_pin_write`

```c
void vx_pin_write(vx_pin p, int value);
```

Drive an OUTPUT pin to `value` (0 or 1). The host propagates the change
through the wiring graph immediately — any other chip with a `pin_watch` on
the wired pin will see the edge.

On a board pin the chip is one driver of the wire, resolved against the
MCU's pad and any other chip on it: while the MCU drives the pad the chip
cannot move it (the host reports the contention and feeds nothing back), and
two chips holding one line resolve as a wired-AND. A pin a bus attach named
as one the bus drives (the `miso` of `vx_spi_attach`, the `tx` of
`vx_uart_attach`, `sda` and `scl` of `vx_i2c_attach`) is the bus's: its
registration mode puts no level on the wire, and an explicit `vx_pin_write`
or `vx_pin_set_mode` by the chip takes it back (a UART chip that turns its
TX into a plain level in an IO mode relies on that).

### `vx_pin_read_analog`

```c
double vx_pin_read_analog(vx_pin p);
```

Read the analog voltage of a pin: the voltage the circuit solve publishes
for the net the pin's pad is on (a potentiometer's wiper, a sensor's output,
a board pin the MCU drives), the same number in every host. A pad on no
net, or on a net the solve has no number for, reads `0.0`. In the browser
the runtime reads the electrical store's solve for the pad's net; a chip
hosted in a QEMU worker or beside the Raspberry Pi guest is handed the same
numbers as `pad_volts`, published by the tab with the chip's record and
again on every solve that moves one of its pads (`null` for a wire that was
removed). Before 2026-09 (board-buses F8) the browser answered the pin's PWM
duty times five and the worker its digital level times five, so an ADC
model written against either read the wrong voltage on a real wiper.

### `vx_pin_wired`

```c
int vx_pin_wired(vx_pin p);
```

`1` when a wire reaches the pin's pad (the diagram puts it on a net), `0`
when the pad is in the air. A model with a UI control that stands in for a
missing wire (an ADC with a slider per channel) reads the control only when
this answers `0`: a wired channel is the circuit's, whatever the slider
says.

### `vx_pin_dac_write`

```c
void vx_pin_dac_write(vx_pin p, double voltage);
```

Drive an analog voltage on a pin. Used by DAC chips.

### `vx_pin_set_mode`

```c
void vx_pin_set_mode(vx_pin p, vx_pin_mode mode);
```

Change a pin's direction after registration, which is how a bidirectional
line (an open-drain protocol, a bus the chip only sometimes drives) is done:

- `VX_OUTPUT_LOW` and `VX_OUTPUT_HIGH` drive that level at once, exactly as
  `vx_pin_write` would.
- `VX_OUTPUT` changes the direction and drives nothing until the first
  `vx_pin_write`.
- `VX_INPUT`, `VX_INPUT_PULLUP` and `VX_INPUT_PULLDOWN` release the line:
  the chip leaves the wire and whatever else holds it decides the level, the
  pad's pull (a `pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP)` in the sketch restores HIGH) or
  another chip; a floating pad keeps the level it had. The chip's own pull
  is not put on a board pin. On the QEMU boards the worker has no pad model,
  so a released pin keeps the last level the chip drove.

### `vx_pin_watch`

```c
void vx_pin_watch(
  vx_pin p,
  vx_edge edge,
  void (*cb)(void* user_data, vx_pin pin, int value),
  void* user_data
);
```

Subscribe to edge events on a pin. The callback fires when the pin's state
crosses the requested edge:

| `edge` | Fires on |
|---|---|
| `VX_EDGE_RISING`  | LOW → HIGH only |
| `VX_EDGE_FALLING` | HIGH → LOW only |
| `VX_EDGE_BOTH`    | every transition |

Inside the callback you have access to the pin handle, the new value, and
your `user_data` pointer (typically a pointer to your chip's state struct).

```c
static void on_clk(void *ud, vx_pin pin, int value) {
  chip_state_t *s = (chip_state_t*)ud;
  if (value) {                              // rising edge
    s->shift_register <<= 1;
    s->shift_register |= vx_pin_read(s->data);
  }
}

vx_pin_watch(clk_pin, VX_EDGE_RISING, on_clk, s);
```

### `vx_pin_watch_stop`

```c
void vx_pin_watch_stop(vx_pin p);
```

Cancels every watch registered for the given pin. Useful when entering a
mode where the chip should ignore inputs (e.g. powered-down state).

---

## Attributes

User-editable parameters. Design-time defaults live in the part inspector
(right-click the chip). On velxio.dev (Pro) a chip's attributes can also be
driven by live controls while the simulation runs; the OSS build reads the
values saved on the component.

### Schema in `chip.json`

```json
"attributes": [
  { "name": "threshold", "label": "Pulses",  "type": "int",   "default": 4,    "min": 1, "max": 1024 },
  { "name": "gain",      "label": "Gain",    "type": "float", "default": 1.0,  "min": 0, "max": 10, "step": 0.1 }
]
```

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `name` | Internal key — what the chip uses in `vx_attr_register` |
| `label` | Human-readable text shown next to the slider |
| `type` | `int` rounds to integer; `float`/`number` keeps decimals |
| `default` | Initial value |
| `min`/`max` | If both present, a slider is shown |
| `step` | Step size (default 1 for int, 0.01 for float) |

### `vx_attr_register`

```c
vx_attr vx_attr_register(const char* name, double default_val);
```

Register an attribute. Returns a handle. The default in `chip.json` takes
precedence over the C-side default if both are set — the C-side default
applies when an instance has no saved value yet.

### `vx_attr_read`

```c
double vx_attr_read(vx_attr a);
```

Read the current value. **Always re-read** inside callbacks — the user can
change the slider while the simulation runs and your chip should pick up
the new value on the next event.

```c
static void on_pulse(void* ud, vx_pin pin, int value) {
  chip_state_t* s = (chip_state_t*)ud;
  s->count++;
  uint32_t threshold = (uint32_t)vx_attr_read(s->threshold);    // re-read live
  if (s->count >= threshold) {
    s->count = 0;
    vx_pin_write(s->out, !s->state);
    s->state = !s->state;
  }
}
```

---

## I2C slave

Velxio routes I2C bus events from the master (the Arduino sketch's
`Wire.beginTransmission(addr)`) to your chip when the address matches.

### Config struct

```c
typedef struct {
  uint8_t  address;       /* 7-bit I2C address */
  uint8_t  _pad[3];
  vx_pin   scl;
  vx_pin   sda;
  bool   (*on_connect)(void* user_data, uint8_t addr, bool is_read);
  uint8_t(*on_read)   (void* user_data);
  bool   (*on_write)  (void* user_data, uint8_t byte);
  void   (*on_stop)   (void* user_data);
  void*    user_data;
  uint32_t reserved[8];
} vx_i2c_config;
_Static_assert(sizeof(vx_i2c_config) == 64, "vx_i2c_config must be 64 bytes");
```

### `vx_i2c_attach`

```c
vx_i2c vx_i2c_attach(const vx_i2c_config* cfg);
```

Attach an I2C slave. Call only from `chip_setup()`. Two instances of the
same chip with different `A0`/`A1`/`A2` settings can coexist — they get
different addresses.

### Callbacks

```c
bool on_connect(void* ud, uint8_t addr, bool is_read);
```
The master started a transaction. Return `true` for ACK, `false` for NACK.
For most chips: just `return true;`. `is_read` tells you whether the master
is about to read or write.

```c
uint8_t on_read(void* ud);
```
The master is reading a byte from your chip. Return the byte to put on
SDA. Called once per byte the master clocks out.

```c
bool on_write(void* ud, uint8_t byte);
```
The master sent a byte. Return `true` to ACK, `false` to NACK (e.g. memory
full).

```c
void on_stop(void* ud);
```
The master issued STOP. Reset any "transaction in progress" state your
chip has — the next `on_connect` is a fresh transaction.

Every START names your address to `on_connect`, a repeated START included:
`Wire.endTransmission(false)` followed by `requestFrom()` reaches you as
`on_connect(write)`, the register byte, `on_connect(read)`, the reads, and
one `on_stop`. That is what the browser runtime and the QEMU workers deliver.
On a QEMU board the bridge reports a repeated START as a STOP followed by a
START, and on a Linux board the guest shim speaks whole transactions, so on
those hosts the chip sees an `on_stop` between the two phases as well. Keep
the register pointer across `on_stop` (the register-map idiom above does)
and a write-then-read serves the right bytes everywhere; only state that
must not survive a STOP belongs in `on_stop`.

A chip may attach several addresses on the same pins (`vx_i2c_attach` once
per address): each has its own callbacks, and a STOP reaches every address
the transaction touched.

### Example: 24C01 EEPROM

```c
typedef enum { ST_IDLE, ST_HAS_POINTER } ee_state;

typedef struct {
  uint8_t  pointer;
  uint8_t  mem[128];
  ee_state state;
} chip_state_t;

static bool i2c_connect(void* ud, uint8_t addr, bool is_read) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  if (!is_read) s->state = ST_IDLE;     // fresh write transaction
  return true;
}

static uint8_t i2c_read(void* ud) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  uint8_t b = s->mem[s->pointer & 0x7f];
  s->pointer++;
  return b;
}

static bool i2c_write(void* ud, uint8_t byte) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  if (s->state == ST_IDLE) {
    s->pointer = byte;
    s->state = ST_HAS_POINTER;
  } else {
    s->mem[s->pointer & 0x7f] = byte;
    s->pointer++;
  }
  return true;
}

void chip_setup(void) {
  chip_state_t* s = calloc(1, sizeof(chip_state_t));
  vx_i2c_config cfg = {
    .address    = 0x50,
    .scl        = vx_pin_register("SCL", VX_INPUT),
    .sda        = vx_pin_register("SDA", VX_INPUT),
    .on_connect = i2c_connect,
    .on_read    = i2c_read,
    .on_write   = i2c_write,
    .on_stop    = NULL,            // optional
    .user_data  = s,
  };
  vx_i2c_attach(&cfg);
}
```

## SPI slave

Buffer-based bidirectional transfer model. The chip pre-fills a buffer with
the bytes to send on MISO; the bus overwrites those bytes with what it
received on MOSI.

### Config struct

```c
typedef struct {
  vx_pin   sck;
  vx_pin   mosi;
  vx_pin   miso;
  vx_pin   cs;          /* the bus honours it: no bytes while deasserted.
                           ((vx_pin)-1) = the chip has no select line */
  uint32_t mode;        /* 0..3 */
  void   (*on_done)(void* user_data, uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t count);
  void*    user_data;
  uint8_t (*on_exchange)(void* user_data, uint8_t mosi);  /* optional, 0 = none */
  uint32_t reserved[7];
} vx_spi_config;
_Static_assert(sizeof(vx_spi_config) == 60, "vx_spi_config must be 60 bytes");
```

### Functions

```c
vx_spi vx_spi_attach(const vx_spi_config* cfg);
void   vx_spi_start (vx_spi s, uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t count);
void   vx_spi_stop  (vx_spi s);
```

### How it works

1. `vx_spi_attach` registers the chip on the bus its `sck` wire reaches. The
   bus clocks the chip only while `cs` is low (a select tied to GND, or
   `((vx_pin)-1)`, means always), compares `mode` and the MSB-first order
   every chip shifts in with the controller's settings, and reports a
   mismatch (`spi-mode`, `spi-bit-order`) instead of emulating the shifted
   bytes. The select edge reaches the chip's own `vx_pin_watch` on `cs`
   whichever block of the board drives it, a GPIO or the SPI peripheral's own
   chip-select output.
2. The chip calls `vx_spi_start(handle, buf, N)` to say "I want to exchange
   N bytes; here's my MISO data."
3. As the master clocks bytes, byte by byte:
   - the master's MOSI byte overwrites `buf[i]`
   - the chip's `buf[i]` (its MISO data) is shifted out to the master
4. After N bytes, `on_done(buf, N)` fires. `buf` now contains the N MOSI
   bytes the master sent, and it is the pointer this handle's own
   `vx_spi_start` armed: a chip with two handles (two selects on one bus,
   or two buses) is handed each one's buffer.

### Answering inside the same byte (`on_exchange`)

The buffer is written before the chip has seen the byte it answers, so the
best a buffer can do is answer one byte behind the question. Most chips never
notice: they answer a command in the bytes after it. A chip whose answer
depends on bits of the SAME byte cannot be right that way. The MCP3008 is the
example: spidev's framing `[1, 0x80 | ch << 4, 0]` puts the top two result
bits in the byte that carries the channel number, and through the buffer
alone they come out of the previous state.

Set `on_exchange` and the host hands the chip every byte a hardware controller
exchanges whole, and takes its return value as the MISO for THAT byte. Shift
the bits through in order and each output bit depends only on the input bits
before it, as on silicon:

```c
static uint8_t on_exchange(void* ud, uint8_t mosi) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  uint8_t miso = clock_byte(s, mosi);  /* 8 clocks, DIN in, DOUT out */
  arm_lookahead(s);                    /* vx_spi_start with the next byte */
  return miso;
}
```

Keep a transfer armed as well: a bit-banged master reads MISO before its byte
is in, and it reads the buffer. The field used to be reserved, so a chip that
leaves it 0 keeps the buffer contract exactly as described above.

### Re-arming

The chip is **not** automatically armed for the next transfer. Call
`vx_spi_start` again inside `on_done` if you want continuous transfer:

```c
static void on_spi_done(void* ud, uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t count) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  s->shift_reg = buffer[0];
  vx_spi_start(s->spi, s->buf, 1);   // re-arm for next byte
}
```

This is needed for chips like 74HC595 that have no real CS — they shift
on every SCK edge as long as data flows.

### Using CS for transaction boundaries

For chips with a real chip-select (e.g. MCP3008), the chip watches its CS
pin and triggers `vx_spi_start` / `vx_spi_stop` accordingly:

```c
static void on_cs_change(void* ud, vx_pin pin, int value) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  if (value == VX_LOW) {
    vx_spi_start(s->spi, s->buf, 3);   // CS asserted — start exchange
  } else {
    vx_spi_stop(s->spi);                // CS released
  }
}

vx_pin_watch(s->cs, VX_EDGE_BOTH, on_cs_change, s);
```

`on_done` fires once per transfer. When the master clocked every byte of
the buffer it has already fired, and the `vx_spi_stop` on the rising edge
finds nothing armed and reports nothing; when the master released the
select part-way, `vx_spi_stop` is what fires it, with the bytes exchanged so
far. The same in the browser, the QEMU workers and the Linux-board host.

---

## UART

### Config struct

```c
typedef struct {
  vx_pin   rx;
  vx_pin   tx;
  uint32_t baud_rate;
  void   (*on_rx_byte) (void* user_data, uint8_t byte);
  void   (*on_tx_done) (void* user_data);
  void*    user_data;
  uint32_t reserved[8];
} vx_uart_config;
_Static_assert(sizeof(vx_uart_config) == 56, "vx_uart_config must be 56 bytes");
```

### Functions

```c
vx_uart vx_uart_attach(const vx_uart_config* cfg);
bool    vx_uart_write (vx_uart u, const uint8_t* buffer, uint32_t count);
```

### Example: ROT13 chip

```c
static void on_rx(void* ud, uint8_t byte) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  uint8_t out = byte;
  if (out >= 'A' && out <= 'Z') out = ((out - 'A' + 13) % 26) + 'A';
  if (out >= 'a' && out <= 'z') out = ((out - 'a' + 13) % 26) + 'a';
  vx_uart_write(s->uart, &out, 1);    // echo back transformed byte
}

void chip_setup(void) {
  chip_state_t* s = malloc(sizeof(chip_state_t));
  vx_uart_config cfg = {
    .rx          = vx_pin_register("RX", VX_INPUT),
    .tx          = vx_pin_register("TX", VX_INPUT_PULLUP),
    .baud_rate   = 115200,
    .on_rx_byte  = on_rx,
    .on_tx_done  = NULL,
    .user_data   = s,
  };
  s->uart = vx_uart_attach(&cfg);
}
```

When the user wires the chip's `RX` pin to the Arduino's pin 1 (TX0), the
host bridges them automatically: every byte the sketch sends with
`Serial.write()` triggers your `on_rx` callback. Your `vx_uart_write` calls
land in `Serial.read()`'s buffer.

---

## Timers and time

```c
uint64_t vx_sim_now_nanos(void);

vx_timer vx_timer_create(void (*cb)(void* user_data), void* user_data);
void     vx_timer_start (vx_timer t, uint64_t period_nanos, bool repeat);
void     vx_timer_stop  (vx_timer t);
```

`vx_sim_now_nanos` is the board's **simulated time**: the guest's cycle count
at its clock rate on the browser engines, the QEMU virtual clock on the QEMU
boards. It starts at 0 when the chip is created, never runs backwards (Stop
and Run, a reload of the firmware or a reset rebuild the guest, and the
chip's clock carries on from where it was) and stands still while the
simulation is stopped. Inside a timer callback it answers the timer's
deadline, so a periodic timer reads exact multiples of its period whatever
the granularity the deadline was reached with.

Timers are anchored to that clock, not to wall-clock seconds: a timer fires
at the guest instant its deadline falls on (between two instructions, never
early), a repeating one adds its period to the deadline, and a 1-ms timer
fires after exactly 1 ms of simulated time whether the host runs the board
faster or slower than real time. `vx_timer_stop` cancels it. A timer armed
before the guest has a clock (an engine before its SoC boots) starts once it
runs. On the QEMU boards the worker's timer thread wakes against the guest
clock in naps of up to 20 ms, so a deadline there carries that much host
jitter (the callback still reads the exact deadline). The Linux-board host
forwards I2C transactions and SPI chip enables to a chip and nothing else:
on a Raspberry Pi a chip's timers do not run.

```c
static void on_tick(void* ud) {
  chip_state_t* s = ud;
  vx_pin_write(s->led, !vx_pin_read(s->led));   // blink at 1 Hz
}

void chip_setup(void) {
  chip_state_t* s = malloc(sizeof(chip_state_t));
  s->led = vx_pin_register("LED", VX_OUTPUT_LOW);
  vx_timer t = vx_timer_create(on_tick, s);
  vx_timer_start(t, 500000000, true);    // 500 ms, repeating
}
```

---

## Display / framebuffer

For chips that drive a screen.

### Schema in `chip.json`

```json
"display": { "width": 128, "height": 64 }
```

Adding this enables a `<canvas>` inside the chip's web component on the
canvas. The chip writes RGBA pixels to a framebuffer; the host repaints the
canvas after each write.

### Functions

```c
typedef int32_t vx_buffer;

vx_buffer vx_framebuffer_init(uint32_t* out_width, uint32_t* out_height);
void      vx_buffer_write    (vx_buffer buf, uint32_t offset, const void* data, uint32_t data_len);
```

### Pixel format

Row-major RGBA8888, no padding. Pixel `(x, y)` lives at byte offset
`(y * width + x) * 4`, bytes `R G B A`.

### Example

```c
uint32_t w, h;
vx_buffer fb = vx_framebuffer_init(&w, &h);

// Fill the screen green
uint8_t green[4] = {0, 0xFF, 0, 0xFF};
for (uint32_t y = 0; y < h; y++) {
  for (uint32_t x = 0; x < w; x++) {
    vx_buffer_write(fb, (y * w + x) * 4, green, 4);
  }
}
```

For real LCDs you typically convert RGB565 → RGBA8888 inline before writing.

---

## Named blobs

Byte storage the host hands your chip by name, and that your chip can write
back to. An attribute carries a number or a line of text; a blob carries a
file: the image of a microSD card, a flash dump, a font ROM. The chip reads
sectors out of it, and the sectors the firmware writes land back in the same
bytes, which is how the card panel in the editor sees what the sketch stored.

```c
uint32_t vx_blob_size(const char* name);
uint32_t vx_blob_read(const char* name, uint32_t offset, uint8_t* dst, uint32_t len);
uint32_t vx_blob_write(const char* name, uint32_t offset, const uint8_t* src, uint32_t len);
```

`vx_blob_size` answers the blob's length. `vx_blob_read` and `vx_blob_write`
each copy `min(len, size - offset)` bytes and **return how many they copied**.
Check the return value: it is the only thing that tells you the transfer was
short.

```c
/* A card model serving one 512-byte sector. */
static bool read_sector(uint32_t sector, uint8_t* buf) {
  return vx_blob_read("card", sector * 512u, buf, 512u) == 512u;
}

static bool write_sector(uint32_t sector, const uint8_t* buf) {
  return vx_blob_write("card", sector * 512u, buf, 512u) == 512u;
}
```

### The rules

Your chip runs in three places: the browser tab, the QEMU worker (ESP32 and
STM32 boards) and the host that drives the Linux boards. All three answer
these calls identically, and here is what they answer.

| Case | `vx_blob_size` | `vx_blob_read` | `vx_blob_write` |
|---|---|---|---|
| The blob the host declared | its length | copies, returns the count | stores, returns the count |
| `offset` past (or at) the end | n/a | 0, `dst` untouched | 0, nothing stored |
| `offset + len` past the end | n/a | copies what fits, returns that | stores what fits, returns that |
| A name the host never declared | 0 | 0, `dst` untouched | 0, nothing stored |
| `NULL` or `""` as the name | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `len` of 0 | n/a | 0 | 0 |

Four things follow, and they are worth stating because a model that assumes
otherwise breaks on one host and not the others:

- **Storage is per chip instance.** Two microSD parts on the canvas each have
  their own `"card"`. Blobs are never shared between instances, and never
  between chips.
- **A chip cannot create a blob.** A name the host did not declare stays empty
  however much you write to it. Storage comes from the part, which is where
  the user picked the file.
- **A blob never grows.** Its size is the device's capacity, so a write off the
  end stops at the end, exactly as addressing a sector past the last one does
  on a real card.
- **Bytes past the returned count are left alone.** A short read does not zero
  or pad the rest of your buffer, so you can tell a truncated sector from a
  sector of zeros.

A write is visible to the next read from the same instance, immediately.

### Blobs and `vx_rom_*`

`vx_rom_size` / `vx_rom_read` stay what they were: ONE read-only image,
injected before `chip_setup`, for a chip that boots a program (a CPU emulator
loading its ROM). A blob is named, there can be several, and the chip writes to
it. Reach for `vx_rom_*` for firmware you only execute, and for a blob for
storage the device owns.

## Logging

```c
void vx_log(const char* msg);
```

Print a message to the host's chip log (browser dev console, prefixed with
`[chip:<componentId>]`).

`printf` also works — it's routed through WASI's `fd_write` syscall to the
same log.

```c
vx_log("EEPROM ready");
printf("Temperature: %.2f °C\n", temp);
```

## Type & constant cheat sheet

```c
// Opaque handles (all int32_t under the hood)
vx_pin    // pin handle
vx_attr   // attribute handle
vx_i2c    // I2C device handle
vx_uart   // UART handle
vx_spi    // SPI handle
vx_timer  // timer handle
vx_buffer // framebuffer handle

// Pin modes
VX_INPUT, VX_OUTPUT, VX_INPUT_PULLUP, VX_INPUT_PULLDOWN, VX_ANALOG
VX_OUTPUT_LOW, VX_OUTPUT_HIGH

// Pin values
VX_LOW (0), VX_HIGH (1)

// Edge mask (combine with bitwise OR if needed)
VX_EDGE_RISING (1), VX_EDGE_FALLING (2), VX_EDGE_BOTH (3)
```

## ABI guarantees

These are checked at compile time inside the header:

- `sizeof(vx_i2c_config)  == 64`
- `sizeof(vx_uart_config) == 56`
- `sizeof(vx_spi_config)  == 60`

If any of these change, your chip won't compile until the runtime side is
updated to match. This is intentional — it catches ABI drift early.

Each config struct also has `uint32_t reserved[]` slots at the end (8 in
`vx_i2c_config` and `vx_uart_config`, 7 in `vx_spi_config`, whose first slot
became `on_exchange`). Zero them out (the Velxio header initializer literally
`= {.field = ...}` syntax zeros unmentioned fields). Future versions may use
those slots; today they must be 0.
