/**
 * SPI configuration.
 *
 * `cs` is the chip's select line, and the bus HONOURS it: the chip is clocked
 * only while that pin is low, as the silicon is. A chip with no select line
 * (a 74HC595, whose RCLK is a latch and not a select) sets it to ((vx_pin)-1)
 * and is always on the bus. The chip still watches the pin itself when it
 * wants the edges, which is the usual way to arm a transfer, and the host
 * puts the select edge on that pin whichever block of the board drives it:
 * a controller that raises its select inside the SPI peripheral (the PL022
 * of the RP2040) moves the chip's CS pin the same way a GPIO does.
 *
 * `sck`, `mosi` and `miso` say which lines the chip is wired to: they decide
 * which bus of the board the chip sits on, so a chip whose miso leg is not
 * wired clocks bytes in and answers nothing.
 *
 * `mode` is the SPI mode (CPOL << 1 | CPHA) the chip is written for, and
 * bytes are exchanged MSB first, as every datasheet the gallery models has
 * them. The bus compares both with the controller's settings and reports a
 * mismatch (`spi-mode`, `spi-bit-order`) rather than shifting the bytes the
 * way the wrong mode would on hardware. There is no clock-rate field: the
 * rate is the controller's, and a chip has nothing to hold against it.
 *
 * `on_done` fires once per transfer, after the `count` bytes of the
 * vx_spi_start() that armed it (fewer when vx_spi_stop() ended it early);
 * `buffer` is the pointer that handle's own vx_spi_start() armed:
 *   - Before the call, `buffer` contains the chip's outgoing MISO bytes.
 *   - After the call, `buffer` contains the master's MOSI bytes received.
 *
 * `on_exchange` is optional (leave it 0, as a designated initializer does).
 * The prefilled buffer above has to be written before the chip has seen the
 * byte it answers, so a chip whose answer depends on bits of the SAME byte
 * cannot give it: the MCP3008 puts result bits in the byte that carries the
 * configuration deciding them, and through the buffer alone the most common
 * framing (spidev's [1, 0x80 | ch << 4, 0]) loses the top two bits of every
 * reading. A chip that sets it is handed each byte a controller exchanges
 * whole and returns the MISO for THAT byte, so it can shift the bits through
 * in order, as the silicon does. The buffer still serves a master that reads
 * MISO before its byte is in (a bit-banged one), so a chip that sets this
 * keeps a transfer armed as well. Every host that understands the field uses
 * it; the field used to be reserved, so an older chip leaves it 0 and keeps
 * the buffer contract unchanged.

 * Named byte storage the host hands the chip, and that the chip can write

 * is a named buffer the chip also OWNS: a microSD model gets the card image as
 * the blob "card", serves sectors out of it, and the sectors the guest writes
 * land back in the same bytes, which is how the card panel in the editor sees
 * them.
 *
 * The rules are the same in every host that runs a chip (the browser, the
 * QEMU worker and the Linux-board host), because a model that behaves
 * differently depending on where it runs is the very thing the bus work
 * exists to remove:
 *
 *   - Storage is PER CHIP INSTANCE. Two microSD parts on the canvas each have
 *     their own "card"; nothing is shared between instances or between chips.
 *   - A blob exists only because the host declared it for this instance. An
 *     unknown name (and a NULL or empty one) has size 0, reads nothing and
 *     accepts nothing: a chip cannot bring storage into being.
 *   - A blob never grows. Its size is the device's capacity, so a write that
 *     runs off the end stops at the end, exactly as addressing a sector past
 *     the last one does on a real card.
 *   - Reads and writes are byte-exact and truncating: both copy
 *     min(len, size - offset) bytes and return how many they copied, 0 when
 *     `offset` is at or past the end. Bytes of `dst` beyond the returned
 *     count are left untouched.
 *   - A write is visible to the next read from the same instance.
 *
 * Typical use, a card model serving a 512-byte sector:
 *
 *   uint32_t n = vx_blob_read("card", sector * 512u, buf, 512u);
 *   if (n < 512u) { ... the card has no such sector ... }
