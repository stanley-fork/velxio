"""The scope report seam: an overlay's materialiser may return a third
element describing HOW the manifest resolved; the hook wrapper parks it in
the `scope_stats` context variable and the compile route's `_scope_of`
copies the known keys into the compile row, the result's own keys winning.
OSS registers nothing, so the variable stays None and nothing changes."""
