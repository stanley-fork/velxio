"""Intellisense symbol server.

Serves editor symbol tables (classes, public methods, constants, enum values)
for the Arduino libraries a host actually has. Extraction is done by the
dependency-free scanner in app.services.symbol_extract, which also mirrors
the pro overlay's cache naming rules; this module never imports app.pro.

Two library layouts answer this endpoint, in that order:

  1. The content-addressed library cache (VELXIO_LIBCACHE_DIR, default
     /var/velxio/libcache — entry dirs named `<norm_name>@<norm_version>-
     <sha12>`). Immutable by construction, so a scan cached under an entry
     name can never go stale and the response is safe to cache hard.
  2. A plain arduino-cli sketchbook `libraries/` dir — what Velxio Desktop's
     sidecar and a self-host have. Entry dirs are named after the library and
     the version lives in library.properties, and they are MUTABLE (`lib
     upgrade` rewrites one in place), so scans are keyed by a cheap content
     stamp instead of by the dir name.

A host with neither simply 404s and the editor degrades to the engine's
embedded catalog.
