esp32_i2c_slaves.py — Standalone I2C slave state machines for ESP32 QEMU simulation.

Each class emulates the I2C register map of a real sensor, handling the picsimlab
I2C event protocol as defined in hw/i2c/picsimlab_i2c.c:

  picsimlab_i2c_ev(event)  → passes raw QEMU i2c_event enum value:
    0x00 = I2C_START_RECV  — firmware doing requestFrom  (read  direction START)
    0x01 = I2C_START_SEND  — firmware doing beginTransmission (write direction START)
    0x02 = I2C_START_SEND_ASYNC  (rarely used)
    0x03 = I2C_FINISH      — end of transaction (STOP or RSTART between write+read)
    0x04 = I2C_NACK

  picsimlab_i2c_tx(data)   → event = (data << 8) | (I2C_NACK+1) = (data<<8)|0x05
  picsimlab_i2c_rx()       → event = I2C_NACK+2 = 0x06  (return data byte to firmware)

ACK convention (matches QEMU i2c core):
  return 0  → ACK  (success, device present / byte accepted)
  return ≠0 → NACK (error)
  For READ events: return value is the data byte delivered to the firmware.

class MPU6050Slave:
    """MPU-6050 6-axis IMU (address 0x68 or 0x69), modelled where a driver can
    tell the difference from the chip. The twin of VirtualMPU6050 in the tab:
    both replay test/fixtures/i2c-vectors/mpu6050.json.

      - It powers on asleep (PWR_MGMT_1 = 0x40), so a sketch that reads
        without waking it reads zeros, as it does on the bench.
      - DEVICE_RESET puts every register back to its power-on value and is
        gone before the next read. Adafruit_MPU6050::reset() polls that bit
        with no timeout.
      - What the panel sets is the world around the chip, not a register: it
        survives a reset, and the sample block 0x3B-0x48 is worked out from it
        and from the full-scale ranges the sketch selected, when a read
        begins. The whole burst is answered from that one sample (4.17), so a
        slider moving while it is read cannot mix two instants.
      - Asleep, the block holds what it held when the chip fell asleep. So
        does an axis in standby (PWR_MGMT_2) and the temperature with
        TEMP_DIS; in CYCLE mode the block moves only at each wake-up, at
        LP_WAKE_CTRL.
      - Awake, it takes a sample every sample period of the guest's time
        (now_ns), whether the sketch talks to it or not. Each one sets
        DATA_RDY_INT when DATA_RDY_EN is set, which a read of INT_STATUS
        clears, and moves the INT pad the way INT_PIN_CFG says (int_pad,
        int_wake_ns). Nothing runs in the background for it: the samples due
        are counted when the chip is next looked at, from the time that has
        passed. With no clock (a libqemu that does not export it) one period
        passes per register pointer the sketch writes, so a driver that waits
        for DATA_RDY still finds it.
      - With USER_CTRL.FIFO_EN set, each sample also pushes the sources
        FIFO_EN selects into the FIFO (1024 bytes, 512 on the MPU-9250), in
        register order. FIFO_COUNT
        is latched when its high byte is read, and FIFO_R_W pops a byte per
        read without moving the pointer (an empty FIFO repeats the last one).
      - BANK_SEL, MEM_START_ADDR and MEM_R_W reach 32 banks of DMP memory,
        the address advancing within its bank and the pointer staying on
        MEM_R_W, with the ROM byte i2cdevlib reads as the hardware revision.
      - With DMP_EN and FIFO_EN set in USER_CTRL, a DMP image it knows (the
        MotionApps 2.0, 4.1 and 6.12 images of i2cdevlib, told apart at the
        program start address of DMP_CFG_1/2) writes its packets into the
        FIFO at the rate the image's divider sets, on the guest's clock, and
        raises DMP_INT for each. The packet carries the orientation of the
        panel: the tilt of the accelerometer and a heading integrated from
        the gyroscope, which DMP_RESET and every start of the DMP put back to
        zero. An image it does not know writes nothing.

    replay test/fixtures/i2c-vectors/bmp280.json.

      - It powers on in sleep mode and measures nothing there (3.6.1): until
        the sketch selects a mode, the data registers hold their reset value
        0x80000.
      - Forced mode is one measurement, and the chip is back in sleep mode
        when it is done (3.6.2). A conversion takes no time here, so the mode
        bits read 00 at once and the measurement is what the panel said at
        the write. esp-idf-lib and M5Unit-ENV wait for those bits, BMP280_DEV
        starts the next conversion only from sleep mode.
      - In normal mode the chip measures by itself (3.6.3): a read finds what
        the panel says when it begins, and the whole burst is answered from
        that one measurement (3.10), so a slider moving while it is read
        cannot mix two of them.
      - `measuring` reads 1 once after a mode write that starts a conversion.
        SparkFun's and pocketBME280's examples wait for it to rise with no
        timeout, Adafruit's takeForcedMeasurement() waits for it to fall.
        Without a clock the cycles of normal mode that follow are not seen in
        status.
      - A write is pairs of register address and register data, and the
        address does not count up (5.2.1, figure 7). A read counts up from
        the last address written (5.2.2).
      - What the panel sets is the world around the chip, not a register: it
        survives a soft reset.

    were compiled next to the sketch's, seconds apart) and nothing in it says
    which one the sketch reads. The tab does the same with the images it

class I2CWriteSink:
    """ACKs all I2C writes, emits complete transaction to frontend on FINISH.

    The echo names the part it belongs to (`owner`, the component id the
    record carries) whenever the record gave one, so the tab hands each write
    phase to that part only: two panels at one address on the two controllers
    of a board no longer draw each other's frames.

    Without a `port` the sink is a write-only panel, which drives nothing, so
    a read is 0xFF. With one it is the PCF8574 of an expander part or an LCD
    backpack. That chip has no registers: every byte written goes to the port
    latch at its acknowledge, and a read returns the pins (PCF8574 datasheet,
    "Writing to the port" / "Reading from the port"). A latch bit of 0 drives
    its pin low; a 1 releases it to the weak pull-up, and the pin then reads
    what the outside drives. `port` is that outside: 0xFF when nothing pulls a
    pin down, 0xF7 on an LCD backpack, whose backlight transistor holds P3
    low. The tab's model (VirtualPCF8574, I2CBusManager.ts) reads the same
    `latch & port`. hd44780_I2Cexp tells the chip from an MCP23008, and finds
    the backpack's wiring, from these reads; against a sink that read 0xFF it
    took the backpack for an MCP23008.

    One class for both, so the workers' checks by class name (no per-event
    log or trace for a sink) keep holding.
