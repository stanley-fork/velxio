"""DHT22 reply for the QEMU ESP32 worker: the sensor's waveform, paced in guest
time, armed by either way a driver releases the line.

Why this module exists. `esp32_worker.py` used to answer a DHT22 only when the
firmware switched the pin to INPUT after holding it LOW: the push-pull idiom of
Adafruit's DHT.h (`pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP)`). It paced the reply by counting the
guest's GPIO_IN reads, because that library measures a pulse by counting
`digitalRead()` iterations. MicroPython's `dht` driver does neither. Its pin is
open-drain for the whole transaction and the release is `gpio_set_level(pin, 1)`,
so the worker saw the start LOW and then nothing, and `measure()` raised
ETIMEDOUT forever (issue #291). That driver also measures pulses in
microseconds (`machine_time_pulse_us`, 100 us timeout per phase, a bit is a HIGH
longer than 48 us), which read counting cannot satisfy: 70 counted reads are
20 us on a fast host and 200 us on a slow one.

So the model here follows the browser one (`simulation/line/models/dht22.ts`):

- The reply is armed by the RELEASE of a line the guest held LOW, in both
  idioms: direction OUTPUT -> INPUT, or a write of 1 while the pad is still an
  output (QEMU only reports level writes on output-enabled pads, so a reported
  write of 1 IS the open-drain release).
- Phases are guest microseconds read off QEMU's virtual clock at every GPIO_IN
  read, the only instant the guest can observe the pad.
- Between two reads the phase clock is credited at most `stall_cap_us` (2 us).
  That one rule serves the two regimes this worker runs in:

    * Under `-icount` (the worker turns it on for a MicroPython run with a
      line sensor) a guest read costs ~0.5-0.9 us of guest time, under the
      cap, so the phase clock IS guest time and a driver that times pulses
      measures 80/26/70 us exactly (checked with `machine.time_pulse_us`).
      A hiccup between two reads (one ~20 us event per frame was measured at
      shift 4) is credited as 2 us, so it moves a phase boundary by nothing
      the guest can notice beyond the hiccup itself.
    * Without `-icount` the guest's clock is host time and a read costs
      40-90 us of it (the read exits into a Python callback), so a phase
      can only be a number of READS. Every gap hits the cap and each read
      credits 2 us: the frame becomes 40/40/25/11/35 reads, which is what a
      read-counting driver (Adafruit's DHT.h compares the reads it made in
      the 50 us LOW against the reads in the HIGH) decodes correctly, and
      which no host stall can disturb. A pulse-timing driver cannot work in
      this regime whatever we do: it would see one read per 40-90 us.

The first edge is placed at the first read after the release rather than inside
the release callback: QEMU copies GPIO_OUT into GPIO_IN after it has run the
write callback, so a level driven from inside that callback is overwritten
before the guest can see it.
