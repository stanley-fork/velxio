"""
Pro board-access gate — server-side enforcement seam.

STM32 and the QEMU-backed Raspberry Pi boards are Pro-only on velxio.dev. The
frontend gate (picker add + run) is the UX layer; this is the server-side
enforcement for the WebSocket simulation start, because on velxio.dev the QEMU
binary is present for every session, so the frontend gate alone is bypassable.

OSS / self-hosted has no binary at all (the start fails with a Pro-framed
message regardless), so this gate is a no-op there.

The pro overlay calls ``register_board_access_gate()`` from ``register_pro()``
with an implementation that resolves the user from the WebSocket cookies and
returns False for a non-paid web user. The desktop sidecar (VELXIO_DESKTOP=1)
always allows — the Tauri license already gates the whole app. Default with no
overlay installed: allow.

This mirrors the existing ``try: from app.pro import register_pro`` extension
pattern — a generic seam any private extension could populate.
