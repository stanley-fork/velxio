"""Priority admission gate for compile jobs.

The compile route used to gate its two build lanes with a plain
`asyncio.Semaphore`. A semaphore is strictly FIFO and knows nothing about who
is waiting, which left two gaps once velxio.dev started seeing real load:

  1. Every build waited the same amount regardless of plan. Paid users had no
     way to get in front of a queue built out of anonymous gallery clicks.
  2. Nothing could tell the user WHY their build had not started. The route
     could see `semaphore.locked()` and nothing else — not whether this job was
     next, not how loaded the server was.

`BuildQueue` replaces the semaphore with an explicit waiting list ordered by
`(priority, arrival)`. It is deliberately unbounded: a build is never refused
and never dropped, no matter how deep the queue gets. Waiting longer is the
only thing that ever happens to a job.

Anti-starvation
---------------
Strict priority alone can park a free user behind an unbroken stream of paid
builds. Each lane therefore keeps `RESERVED_STANDARD_SLOTS` of its capacity out
of reach of priority jobs *while a standard job is waiting*: priority builds may
occupy at most `capacity - RESERVED_STANDARD_SLOTS` slots, and the remaining
slot admits the longest-waiting standard job. With the default capacities that
is 1 priority + 1 shared on the heavy lane and 2 priority + 1 shared on the
light one. When no standard job is waiting the reservation costs nothing —
priority jobs use the whole lane.

The reservation is skipped for a lane with `capacity < 2`, where holding a slot
back would invert the priority order instead of merely softening it.

Priority burst
--------------
Ordering alone still leaves a paid build waiting for a slot when the lane is
full of standard builds. A lane may therefore carry `priority_burst` extra
admissions that ONLY priority jobs can use: while fewer than `capacity +
priority_burst` jobs run, a waiting priority job is admitted at once, above
capacity. Standard jobs never use the burst, and the reserved standard slot
still holds on the regular slots, so a free build keeps advancing exactly as
before; the cost is one extra build on the box for the seconds it runs. The
burst is what turns "compiled first" into "starts now" for a subscriber on
velxio.dev, and it is 0 (off) unless the deployment sets it.

Privacy
-------
`load_level()` is the ONLY queue fact this module is meant to reach a client
with, and it is a coarse label. Queue depth, position and waiter counts stay
server-side on purpose: telling a visitor "you are 14th in line" is worse than
telling them nothing, and it leaks how busy (or quiet) the service is.
