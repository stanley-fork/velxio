"""
i2c_bus_table.py: the I2C targets a QEMU worker hosts, by (bus, address)
(project board-buses-2026-09, F5).

QEMU asks for the answer to every I2C event synchronously
(picsimlab_i2c_event(bus_id, addr, op | data << 8)), so the models that answer
(the MPU6050, DS3231, BMP280 twins, the write sinks behind the tab's displays,
custom chips, the cross-board proxy) live in the worker beside the guest. They
used to live in one dict keyed by address alone: two identical sensors on Wire
and Wire1 were one device, a sensor wired to Wire1 answered Wire's probes, and
removing one of two same-address devices removed whichever sat in the slot
(the worker-i2c-slaves-ignore-bus-id finding).

This table keeps the rules the tab's fabric keeps (simulation/buses/i2cBus.ts),
on the worker's side of the wire:

  - a registration is an IDENTITY (the key its caller chose: the sensor record's
    pin, the proxy's address), never an address, and it leaves by that key;
  - a target answers on the controller its SDA is wired to, and only there;
  - every target that has the address sees the START and the controller reads
    an ACK if any of them ACKs; a read with several answering is the
    wired-AND of their bytes, plus an `i2c-address-conflict` diagnostic;
  - an address nobody has on that controller is not this table's to answer.

Which controller a target is on comes from, in this order:

  1. the tab's bus map (`bus_map.i2c`, F5-SPEC "Motores"): the fabric walked
     the nets and names the controller whose SDA the target's SDA is on, or,
     when it cannot (an ESP32's Wire1 has no default pins; the GPIO matrix
     picks them at run time), the board pin, which the worker resolves
     against the live routing through `resolve_bus`. An owner the map lists
     as unplaced is wired to no board's bus and answers nothing;
  2. the record's own `bus` field, for a caller that names it directly;
  3. otherwise every controller, which is what a record from a part that is
     not on the fabric yet has always had. Kept on purpose, so an unmigrated
     part keeps working; it is the only place an address still answers on a
     bus it may not be wired to, and it goes when the last part migrates.

Owners link a map entry to a registration: a record's `owner` field, else its
`component_id`, the same identity the tab's registry keys the target by.

The table is plain Python with no QEMU in it, so the ESP32 worker and the
STM32 worker (pro/backend/app/pro_boards/stm32_worker.py) share it and it is
tested on its own.
