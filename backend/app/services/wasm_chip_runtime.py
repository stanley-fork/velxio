"""WASM Chip Runtime — Python port of frontend/src/simulation/customChips/ChipRuntime.ts.

Loads a Velxio Custom Chip (.wasm compiled from C against velxio-chip.h) and
runs it inside the same process as the QEMU worker, so I2C events the firmware
generates are answered SYNCHRONOUSLY by the chip — no WebSocket round-trip,
no race condition.

Architecture rationale: see docs/wiki/esp32-i2c-slave-simulation.md. The
existing Python slaves (MPU6050Slave, BMP280Slave, …) are hardcoded; this
runtime delegates the slave logic to a user-provided WASM, making the system
generic for any chip the user writes.

Scope of this MVP:
- Pin register/read/write (digital)
- Attributes (vx_attr_register / vx_attr_read)
- Named blobs (vx_blob_size / vx_blob_read / vx_blob_write)
- I2C slave (vx_i2c_attach + 4 callbacks)
- vx_log + printf via WASI fd_write
- vx_sim_now_nanos and the timers, on the clock the host hands over (the
  QEMU workers pass the guest's virtual clock; without one, host time)
- SPI, one armed buffer per vx_spi_attach handle, behind the chip's own select
- UART, pin watch, framebuffer

The contract every call follows is the header's (backend/sdk/velxio-chip.h),
and the browser runtime (frontend/src/simulation/customChips/ChipRuntime.ts)
answers the same for the same call: one chip model runs beside the CPU here
and in the tab, and the cross-host table
(frontend/src/__tests__/board-buses/fixtures/chips-abi-parity/) is what holds
the two to one answer.

    # the memory's base address only moves when the memory GROWS, and it only
    # grows while wasm code runs, so the view is dropped around the two places
