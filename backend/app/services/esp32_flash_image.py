"""Helpers for ESP32 flash images shared between the in-process bridge and
the subprocess worker.

The ESP-IDF compiler in `espidf_compiler.py` builds a full 4 MB merged flash
image and then **trims the trailing 0xFF padding** before serializing the
binary into the JSON compile response (issue #101 — sending the full 4 MB
gave a ~5.5 MB base64 string that nginx / Cloudflare would buffer-fail with
"No response from server"). The frontend stores the trimmed bytes; this
module re-pads them on the receiving side just before QEMU attaches the
image as an MTD drive — QEMU rejects flash sizes that aren't a power-of-2
megabyte (2 / 4 / 8 / 16 MB).

This is a lossless round trip: bytes after `last_used` in the compiler's
merge are 0xFF by construction, so trim → pad reproduces the original
image byte-for-byte.
