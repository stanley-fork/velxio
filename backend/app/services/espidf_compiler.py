"""
ESP-IDF Compilation Service for ESP32 targets.

Replaces arduino-cli for ESP32/ESP32-C3 compilation.  User Arduino sketches
are compiled using ESP-IDF (with optional Arduino-as-component) to produce
firmware that boots reliably in the lcgamboa QEMU fork.

The key difference vs arduino-cli: ESP-IDF gives control over bootloader,
sdkconfig, and flash mapping — all of which must be QEMU-compatible.

Two compilation modes:
  1. Arduino-as-component: Full Arduino API (WiFi.h, WebServer.h, etc.)
     compiled through idf.py.  Requires ARDUINO_ESP32_PATH env var.
  2. Pure ESP-IDF: Translates common Arduino patterns to ESP-IDF C APIs.
     Fallback when Arduino component is not installed.

# ── Per-library include roots (Arduino-faithful layout) ──────────────────────
# The merged `user_libs_all` component used to copy every library's files into
# ONE interleaved tree and then put EVERY directory that held a file on the
# component's public INCLUDE_DIRS. That is the root cause of the header-shadow
# bug class: a library's private internals — FastLED's host-test
# `src/platforms/stub/Arduino.h`, its `src/fl/stl/asio/http/http_parser.h`,
# LovyanGFX's `src/lgfx/internal/limits.h` — landed on the global -I and
# hijacked `#include`s issued by OTHER libraries, by the arduino-esp32 core and
# by ESP-IDF itself. Every fix was another name in `_SHADOW_STD_HEADERS`, i.e.
# chasing symptoms: the denylist grows with every library that ships a
# generically-named internal header.
#
# arduino-cli — the resolver every other Velxio board family already delegates
# to — shares one global -I list too, but adds exactly ONE directory per
# library: `<lib>/src` for the recursive layout, `<lib>` for the legacy flat
# one, never a subdirectory (its header index is non-recursive, so
# `src/sub/foo.h` is only ever reachable as `<sub/foo.h>`). `utility/` stays
# private to the library that owns it. arduino-esp32 does the same as an IDF
# component: one public include dir per bundled library.
#
# So: keep the single component — a component per library would trade this bug
# for REQUIRES-order shadowing (IDF exports component includes as plain -I,
# never -isystem) plus IDF-component name collisions — but give each library
# its own subtree and publish only its include root.

        BFS over ext_headers (and transitive includes) to discover all external
        Arduino libraries and merge them into a single 'user_libs_all' IDF component.

        `allowed_libraries` (P2 — project library manifest / scope): when not
        None, a USER-installed library (from arduino_libs) is merged only if its
        name is in this set. This makes the project's declared manifest the
        resolution SCOPE — the compiler never picks up an unrelated library from
        the shared dir (another user's install, or a same-named clash). When
        None (no manifest supplied) the behaviour is the legacy scan-all, so
        existing callers and un-migrated projects are unaffected. Core
        arduino-esp32 libs and bundled esp32_libs are always allowed (they are
        platform-provided, not user installs).

        Layout (see the _PER_LIB_ROOTS note at module scope): every library is
        copied into its OWN subtree of the component and exports exactly ONE
        include root — `<lib>/src`, or `<lib>` for the flat legacy layout, with
        `utility/` kept PRIVATE. That is arduino-cli's model, and the reason a
        library's private internals can no longer hijack another library's (or
        the core's, or ESP-IDF's) `#include`s. One component is deliberate: a
        component per library would swap this failure mode for REQUIRES-order
        shadowing plus IDF component-name collisions, and buys no caching that
        ccache does not already provide.

        Search priority per header:
          1. arduino_libs (user-installed via Library Manager) → merge into component
          2. esp32_libs   (bundled with arduino-esp32) → skip core libs (Wire, SPI, …);
             merge non-core libs (e.g. Adafruit libs shipped with arduino-esp32)
          3. not found → warning only

        Returns:
            component_names  — ['user_libs_all'] if any lib found, else []
            header_to_comp   — every resolved header → 'user_libs_all'

        compiler never opens, and — worse — it cannot see a guard that lives
        one file up. FastLED is the case that forced this:

            src/platforms/adafruit/clockless.cpp.hpp:7
                #if FL_HAS_INCLUDE(<Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>)
                #include "platforms/adafruit/clockless_real.hpp"
            src/platforms/adafruit/clockless_real.hpp:10
                #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>          <- no guard here

        clockless_real.hpp is only reachable from inside that probe, but read
        standalone it looks like an unconditional dependency. An eight-LED
        blink merged fifteen libraries and died inside Adafruit TinyUSB.

        ENTRY POINTS are the compiled sources UNION every header directly at
        the library's include root. The header half is load-bearing, not
        decoration: entering only from sources reaches nothing at all in a
        header-only library (ArduinoJson has no .cpp) and loses
        <Adafruit_GFX.h> from GxEPD2, which is precisely the regression this
        file records for 2026-08-15.

        INTERNAL RESOLUTION mirrors what GCC does under the one-root-per-
        library -I layout (_PER_LIB_ROOTS):
          1. quoted form only: the includer's own directory, which always
             wins for "..." whatever -I says;
          2. either form: the library's single exported include root;
          3. flat layout only: utility/, the other root such libraries get.
        A spec that resolves inside the library contributes NOTHING external:
        it is the library's own file, not a dependency. That is the
        generalised form of "a library's own header is not external", which
        is how FastLED's `#include "lib8tion.h"` used to resolve to UncleRus
        (an unrelated sensor bundle scoring higher on architectures=esp32).

        best-named candidate instead of the first alphabetical one.

        First-alphabetical was how <Servo.h> (6 providers in the live cache)
        could resolve to a random lib that merely ships a same-named file,
        and how generic headers landed on unrelated libraries. Scoring:

          +100  normalized library name == normalized header stem
                ("Servo.h" -> the lib actually named Servo/ESP32Servo...)
           +40  library.properties architectures lists esp32 explicitly
                (purpose-built beats a wildcard/absent declaration)
           +20  library name CONTAINS the header stem, minus a length
                penalty so "servo" outranks "simpleservoesp32"

        Alphabetical remains the final tie-break so resolution stays
        deterministic. Libraries with score 0 still resolve (legacy
        behaviour) — this only changes WHICH provider wins when several
        exist.

        Build dir layout:
        - With VELXIO_PERSISTENT_BUILD_DIR=1 (default): a per-target dir at
          /var/lib/velxio-build/<idf_target>/project/ is reused across compiles.
          ninja's incremental cache + ccache hits combine to bring warm
          compiles down to ~5-30s.
        - With VELXIO_PERSISTENT_BUILD_DIR=0: legacy tempfile.TemporaryDirectory
          flow. Every compile rebuilds from scratch.

        The caller (routes/compile.py:_compile_job) holds a per-target
        asyncio.Lock for the duration of this call, so the persistent dir
        is never accessed by two compiles at once.

        progress_callback (optional): if provided, called from a worker
        thread for every stdout/stderr line as cmake and ninja run. Used
        by the async compile path to expose live build output to clients
        polling /api/compile/status/{job_id}.

        board_options (optional): per-board ESP32 build options from the
        UI (Partition Scheme, CPU Frequency, Flash Mode, PSRAM, etc.).
        Missing keys fall back to historical defaults so AVR/RP2040 callers
        and pre-feature clients still get a working build. Note that
        SPIFFS files are NOT folded into the cache-invalidation hash —
        only sdkconfig-affecting options are — because the SPIFFS image is
        rebuilt on every compile anyway and folding it in would burn the
        C/C++ ninja cache on every file edit.

        pure_idf: pure ESP-IDF language mode (issue #139). The user's files
        ARE the IDF main component sources (they provide app_main()); the
        arduino-esp32 component is left out of the build entirely and
        Arduino library resolution is skipped. Gets its own persistent
        build-dir variant via the eff_hash fold below.
