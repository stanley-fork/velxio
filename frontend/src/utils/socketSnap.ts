/**
 * Board-on-socket magnet — how a shield takes a board.
 *
 * Some components ARE sockets: the Seeed Round Display's back header takes a
 * XIAO the way a breadboard takes a part. Dragging the board near the socket
 * snaps it so the two pin grids coincide, exactly like the real stack; drag it
 * past the tolerance and it comes free again. Same feel as the breadboard
 * magnet in breadboardSnap.ts, but for BOARDS (which move through
 * setBoardPosition, not the component path).
 *
 * The contract is rule-6a style — read from the DOM element like pinInfo, so
 * private-overlay components can declare a socket without this file knowing
 * they exist:
 *
 *   get boardSocket(): { anchorPin: string; accepts: string[] }
 *
 * `anchorPin` names one of the component's OWN pinInfo pads. A dragged board
 * whose boardKind starts with any `accepts` prefix snaps so that ITS pad of
 * the same name lands on that pad. One anchor is enough: both sides lay out
 * their remaining pads at the same physical pitch, which is the whole point
 * of a socket.
