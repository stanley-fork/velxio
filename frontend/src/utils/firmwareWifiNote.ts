 * Tell someone their uploaded firmware will never find a network (issue #270).
 *
 * A sketch compiled inside Velxio has its WiFi SSID rewritten on the way to
 * the emulator, because the emulated radio broadcasts a fixed set of networks
 * and nothing else. Firmware that arrives already built — from the Arduino
 * IDE, from Visuino, from anywhere — skips that step by construction: there is
 * no compile to rewrite anything. So it boots, runs, and hunts for a network
 * that does not exist here, which looks like the emulator failing rather than
 * a configuration mismatch. The reporter of #270 lost an afternoon to exactly
 * that with a binary that was, in every other respect, working.

 * present in the WiFi one. `WIFI_INIT` looked obvious and is in BOTH, so it is
 * not here.
 *
 * They are IDF-level names on purpose. The first version of this list used the
 * Arduino log strings ('WiFiGeneric', 'STA.cpp'), which vanish when the build
 * lowers its debug level — the reporter's own second binary has neither, and
 * the note would have stayed silent on the exact firmware it was written for.
 * These survive, because they are the driver, not a message about it.
