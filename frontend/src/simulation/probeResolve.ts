/**
 * Decide what a clicked wire actually carries, so the scope can probe it.
 *
 * The oscilloscope was born as a logic analyzer: channels keyed (boardId, pin)
 * and fed by GPIO transitions with CPU-cycle timestamps. That is the right
 * source when the wire really does hang off a board pin — microsecond
 * resolution, no solver involved — and the wrong one for a resistor divider,
 * which no GPIO drives.
 *
 * So resolution is ordered, best source first:
 *
 *   1. A wire endpoint sitting ON a board pin that maps to a GPIO number.
 *   2. A wire that reaches a GPIO through passives (a series resistor into an
 *      LED still shows the driving pin's square wave). PinTrace already knows
 *      how to walk that and, importantly, tells us when the hop crossed an
 *      ACTIVE device — past a transistor the pin's logic level no longer
 *      describes this wire, so we stop trusting it.
 *   3. Otherwise the SPICE net, read as a voltage.
 *
 * Net names come from the pinNetMap the solver PUBLISHES, never from a local
 * re-derivation. Names are positional (n0, n1, ...), so any disagreement about
 * how many nets exist shifts every later name and the probe silently reports a
 * neighbouring node — the exact bug fixed in 340e207c for the voltmeter and the
 * overlay, and the reason this module reads the published map like they do.
