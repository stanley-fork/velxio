/**
 * PinTrace — "which board pin is this component pin wired to?"
 *
 * The wire graph is not a chain of point-to-point links: a NET is every pin
 * the wires transitively join, and a component pin can carry more than one
 * wire. This walk answers, for one (component, pin), the board GPIO that owns
 * its net — tracing through 2-terminal passives (a resistor in series is
 * electrically transparent to the digital layer), through breadboard strips,
 * and through a socket a board is seated on.
 *
 * It used to live inside components/DynamicComponent.tsx. It moved here so the
 * store can use the SAME answer when it pre-registers backend sensors: two
 * copies of "find the board pin" that disagreed is exactly how an HC-SR04
 * behind a level-shifting divider ended up with an echo pin nobody had wired
 * (see the sensor pre-registration in useSimulatorStore.startBoard).
 *
 * Dependency-light on purpose (no React, no store VALUE import) so both the
 * renderer and the store can import it.

/**
 * A NET is a set of pins, not a path through them.
 *
 * That sentence is the whole fix. The walk used to follow one chain of wires
 * and answer with the first thing it bumped into, so the answer depended on
 * which wire the user drew first, and a pin one wire away from the MCU was
 * invisible if some other branch reached a rail sooner. What a net is:
 *
 *   NODE   — every pin joined without crossing a component: the wires between
 *            them, and the holes of one breadboard strip. Same electrical
 *            point, so the walk collects the whole set before judging it.
 *   HOP    — crossing a 2-terminal passive to its far pin lands on a DIFFERENT
 *            node, one step further from the start, and costs one of MAX_HOPS.
 *
 * With the node in hand the answer is a property of the set, in this order:
 *
 *   1. a driven board pin ON this node — a real GPIO, wins outright;
 *   2. a supply/GND pad on this node: the node IS the rail, and the walk stops
 *      there. It must never continue out the far side, or a cathode on the
 *      ground plane would resolve to whatever GPIO a button's pull-down hangs
 *      off — the plane joins them, the signal does not;
 *   3. a driven pin one or more HOPS away — this is what makes a level-shifted
 *      sensor work: the walk crosses the divider's top resistor and finds the
 *      MCU on the tap;
 *   4. a rail one or more hops away (a pull-up, the divider's low leg) — real,
 *      but weaker than any driven pin anywhere;
 *   5. a custom-chip pin: the net-canonical key when several chips share the
 *      net (the chip bus), else the neighbour's own synthetic pin.
 *
 * `crossedActiveDevice` reports whether a hop went through a BJT / MOSFET /
 * op-amp / diode, which is what makes the resolver pick its SPICE-resolved
 * flavour over the digital fast path.
