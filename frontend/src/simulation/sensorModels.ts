/**
 * sensorModels — the one declaration of the sensors whose MODEL drives the line.
 *
 * A handful of parts are not in the SPICE netlist and are not driven by the
 * host either: the sensor's own model owns the wire for the whole exchange. An
 * HC-SR04 answers a trigger with a timed ECHO pulse; a DHT22 bit-bangs a
 * 40-bit frame on its DATA line. Whoever emulates that model — the backend
 * QEMU worker, or an in-browser engine's sensor hub — is the only thing
 * allowed to move those pads, and every other layer has to stand down.
 *
 * That fact used to be written down in several places at once: a set of type
 * names in the ESP32 bridge, a union type and a pair of `if (type === ...)`
 * branches in the overlay's hub, and a wiring map in the store. Nothing tied
 * them together, so adding a third single-wire sensor meant finding all of
 * them, and missing one was silent — exactly the failure that cost an HC-SR04
 * its echo pin. This module is the single list; the code that MODELS each
 * sensor stays where it is (that is real per-device behaviour, not a list).
 *
 * NOT in here on purpose: sensors that register through the same channel but
 * only LISTEN — an ePaper panel's DC / CS / RST, a membrane keypad's rows, any
 * I2C device on a virtual 200+addr pin. The host drives those, so they must
 * stay drivable.
 *
 * Adding a single-wire sensor: one entry here, plus the model itself (a part
 * under simulation/parts and, for the in-browser engines, a case in the
 * overlay's singleWireSensors). Nothing else needs to learn its name.

 *
 * The single-wire sensors contribute their data pin plus whatever extra pins
 * they declare. The other two entries are models that own a pad WITHOUT being
 * single-wire, which is why a plain "is it a single-wire sensor?" test was not
 * enough:
 *
 *  - a matrix keypad's COLUMNS are driven by the model (the QEMU worker even
 *    keeps a `_keypad_cols_owned` set); the firmware scans them as inputs;
 *  - an ePaper panel drives BUSY to tell the firmware it is refreshing. Its
 *    DC / CS / RST are the opposite case — the host drives those, so they are
 *    deliberately absent.
 *
 * Neither is broken with plain wiring today, because the connector's older
 * `sourcedNets` gate happens to skip a net nothing else sits on. Put a pull-up
 * on a keypad column and that gate stops holding — which is exactly how a
 * level-shifted HC-SR04 lost its echo.
