/**
 * The pads a board INSTANCE actually has, and the pin number each one carries.
 *
 * The oscilloscope's channel picker used to answer this from a switch over
 * BoardKind. A table like that is wrong the day a board is added, and silently
 * wrong for every family it does not list: they all fell through to the Uno's
 * D0-D13 / A0-A5, so an STM32's PA0, an RP2350's GP15 and a XIAO's pads were
 * never offered at all — and the "D2" it did offer on a XIAO keyed the channel
 * on Arduino pin 2 while that pad is chip pin 10, which draws a flat line on a
 * pin that is moving. A wrong trace is worse than no trace.
 *
 * Both halves of the answer already exist in the app, so this asks them rather
 * than restating them:
 *
 *   - WHICH pads: the board's custom element publishes `pinInfo` — the same
 *     list the canvas mounts its pin overlays from and wires connect through.
 *   - WHAT NUMBER each pad carries: `pinNameToArduinoPin`, the one mapping the
 *     netlist, the MCU-edge listeners and the wire probe already key on, and
 *     therefore the number a simulator reports through `onPinChangeWithTime`.
 *
 * A board an overlay registers tomorrow is listed correctly with nothing to
 * update here.
