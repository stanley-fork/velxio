/**
 * Feed the oscilloscope's analog channels from the SPICE solver.
 *
 * Two facts about the engine shape everything here, and both are the opposite
 * of what a scope normally assumes:
 *
 *  - There is no streaming transient. The vendored WASM ngspice is
 *    single-threaded and every solve RELOADS the circuit and runs from t=0, so
 *    successive captures are not continuous with each other. Each capture is
 *    therefore presented as one triggered window — the way a real scope in
 *    Auto mode redraws a fresh sweep — never stitched into a running timeline
 *    that never happened.
 *  - Whether a transient runs at all is decided by circuit CONTENTS
 *    (`pickDynamicAnalysis` looks for a non-DC source or a driven reactive
 *    part). A plain resistor divider solves as `.op` and produces no waveform
 *    at all. So while an analog channel exists we ask for transient
 *    explicitly, and re-ask on a timer to keep the window fresh.
 *
 * The subscription is driven by the channel list: no analog channels means no
 * forced transient and no timer, so a user who never probes a wire pays
 * nothing.
