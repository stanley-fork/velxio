/**
 * connectDigitalInputsToMcu — drive ESP32 digital input pins from the
 * solved circuit, so `digitalRead()` reflects the REAL wiring.
 *
 * The ESP32 runs in backend QEMU; its GPIO input register is fed only by
 * whatever the host injects via `esp32_gpio_in`. Historically a button was
 * faked by the part layer (BasicParts seeds the pin HIGH and toggles it on
 * press) — which ignores the actual circuit, so a mis-wired button still
 * "worked". This connector replaces that for ESP32: after every SPICE solve
 * it thresholds each input pin's net voltage and pushes the logic level into
 * QEMU. Now the internal pull-up (modelled as a netlist resistor), the button
 * switch, the GND connection and any short are all honoured — a button wired
 * to the wrong terminal reads stuck-LOW, exactly like real silicon.
 *
 * Mirrors `connectAnalogInputsToMcu` (ADC path) and `connectChipInputsToSolve`
 * (custom-chip path): it knows ONLY the electrical store shape.
 *
 * Only pins the MCU is NOT actively driving as outputs are injected, so we
 * never fight a `digitalWrite`. Every simulator that opts in with
 * `spiceDrivenInputs` takes this path — AVR, RP2040, STM32 and the ESP32
 * bridges all do today.
 *
 * TWO kinds of pin are left alone, and the reason is the same for both: some
 * parts have no electrical model at all, so the solved node says nothing about
 * what they are doing.
 *  - pins a PART drives itself (simulation/partPinOwnership): an HC-SR04's
 *    ECHO pulse, a DHT22's frame, a rotary encoder's edges;
 *  - pins the board's own bridge reports as sensor-owned (`ownsPin`), which is
 *    what a backend- or engine-emulated sensor registers.
 * The older `sourcedNets` gate below tried to cover this by skipping nets no
 * component sits on, and that works right up until the user wires the sensor
 * the way real hardware needs it — a pull-up, or the level divider a 5 V
 * HC-SR04 needs to talk to a 3.3 V pad. Then the net IS component-backed, it
 * solves at whatever the passives say (~0 V, since nothing models the sensor's
 * output), and this connector pins the very line the sensor is answering on.
