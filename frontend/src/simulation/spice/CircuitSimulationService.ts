/**
 * CircuitSimulationService — the orchestration layer that owns the
 * simulation loop.
 *
 * Responsibilities (single, well-defined):
 *   1. Listen to canvas state via an injected SimulatorStorePort.
 *   2. Build the SPICE netlist via NetlistBuilder.
 *   3. Drive the scheduler (loadCircuit + resolveDc / resolveTran).
 *   4. Extract every voltage / branch current / waveform from the
 *      scheduler's last SolveResult and publish to the
 *      ElectricalStorePort so the 12 downstream consumers (ADC
 *      injection, instruments, overlays) keep working.
 *   5. Integrate MCU pad edges in time (PadTimeline): every window the
 *      states the pads held are solved once each (cached by state) and
 *      published with the share of the window each one took, next to the
 *      instantaneous latest state. One solver use at a time.
 *
 * Single source of truth: this service replaces the trio of
 *   - wireElectricalSolver (legacy)
 *   - connectLegacySolverToMixedMode (bridge)
 *   - connectMixedModeSchedulerToStore (Phase 1c step 1)
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - Depends on PORTS only (SimulatorStorePort, ElectricalStorePort,
 *     MixedModeSchedulerPort).  Easy to test with fakes.
 *   - No useSimulatorStore / useElectricalStore imports in this file
 *     — those bindings live in the wiring file (start.ts).
 *   - No SPICE-engine knowledge — that's in the adapters.
