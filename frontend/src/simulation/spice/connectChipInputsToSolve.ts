/**
 * connectChipInputsToSolve — feed solved net voltages back into custom-chip
 * INPUT pins, so a chip can read buttons / switches / sensors with no board.
 *
 * A custom chip already drives its OUTPUT pins into the netlist (chipPinDrives
 * -> SPICE voltage sources -> LEDs light). The INPUT direction was missing: a
 * chip pin wired to a pushbutton / switch / sensor had its net solved by
 * ngspice, but NOTHING wrote that net's state back to the PinManager key the
 * chip reads via `vx_pin_read`. So a chip could light LEDs board-less but never
 * read an input without an Arduino driving the pin.
 *
 * After every solve we look up each wired chip pin's net voltage, threshold it
 * to HIGH/LOW, and `triggerPinChange()` the chip's synthetic pin — which both
 * updates `getPinState` (polling reads) and fires the chip's `onPinChange` edge
 * handlers. Pins the chip is actively DRIVING are skipped so we never fight its
 * own outputs. This is the input counterpart of the chip-output SPICE path and
 * is solver-agnostic — it reads only the electrical store shape.
