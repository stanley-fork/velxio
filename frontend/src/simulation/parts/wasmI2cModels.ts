/**
 * I2C parts answered by their compiled model (project
 * i2c-model-fidelity-2026-09, P5, decision O4).
 *
 * The microSD card already runs as ONE model in C (buses/models/microsd.c)
 * that the tab, the QEMU workers and the Linux-board host all run. The two
 * real-time clocks, the BMP280 and the MPU-6050 now do too:
 * buses/models/ds1307.c and ds3231.c (on the shared buses/models/rtc.h),
 * bmp280.c and mpu6050.c, hosted here by ChipRuntime in place of
 * VirtualDS1307, VirtualDS3231, VirtualBMP280 and VirtualMPU6050, and in the
 * worker from the same bytes (backend/app/services/wasm_i2c_models.py), which
 * the part puts in the worker's record (`wasmB64`).
 *
 * On by default. `?i2cwasm=off` or localStorage `velxio.i2cwasm = 'off'` goes
 * back to the hand-written models in both hosts; a comma list
 * (`?i2cwasm=ds3231`) runs only the models it names. A model that cannot be
 * built keeps the hand-written one for that part, and a record without the
 * bytes keeps the worker's Python twin, so neither the flag nor a broken
 * build can cost a user the part.
 *
 * The bytes are compiled into the bundle (buses/models/i2cModelBytes
 * .generated.ts, written by build.sh): a part attaches synchronously and has
 * to answer the guest's first START, so its model cannot wait for a fetch.
