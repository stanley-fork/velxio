 * browser's. The two are not the same rate: an emulated board runs slower than
 * real time under load, so a signal stepped by `performance.now()` sweeps past
 * a guest that is only managing a couple of loop iterations a second. The
 * sketch then aliases it — samples land at effectively random phases and a
 * beat / period measured from `millis()` comes out nowhere near what the part
 * was asked to produce.
 *
 * Sources, in order:
 *  - `getGuestMicros()` — engines that carry their own virtual clock but no
 *    CPU cycle counter the host can read (the in-browser ESP32 engines).
 *  - `getCurrentCycles()` + `getClockHz()` — AVR and RP2040.
 *
 * NOTE the cycle path is deliberately NOT reached through a "does this board
 * have cycles?" test: several parts use `getCurrentCycles() >= 0` to tell an
 * AVR from an ESP32 bridge, so that predicate must keep meaning what it does.
 *
 * Returns null for a backend-QEMU board, whose clock lives in another process;
 * callers fall back to wall time.
