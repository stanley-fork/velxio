/**
 * The microSD card, SD-over-SPI: ONE JavaScript model for every host in this
 * tab (project board-buses-2026-09, F4).
 *
 * One model, because three had drifted apart before F4 (a JS one per overlay
 * engine, one inside the OSS part, one in Python for the QEMU worker): only
 * one had ACMD51 (without it no ESP-IDF app could mount), only one tracked the
 * idle bit, and one answered R1 one byte early, where IDF's fixed
 * `sdspi_hw_cmd_t` layout cannot see it.
 *
 * So the most complete of the three was moved here, to OSS, where the canvas
 * part and a board's built-in slot both reach it, and the other two were
 * retired: the Python one by the portable model that now runs beside the guest
 * (`buses/models/microsd.c`), the part's own by this file.
 *
 * Three hard-won details, all of them paid for once:
 *
 *  - reply-FIRST: the MISO shifted out for a transfer was prepared by EARLIER
 *    bytes (full-duplex). transfer() returns the queued byte, THEN consumes
 *    the new MOSI. This gives the Ncr command->response latency SD hosts
 *    expect: R1 arrives on the 0xFF clocks the host sends AFTER the six
 *    command bytes (the classic "poll for R1" loop), never on the command's
 *    last byte. Ncr is TWO byte times (see pushNcr) - a 1-byte Ncr answers at
 *    offset 6, which ESP-IDF's fixed sdspi_hw_cmd_t layout cannot see.
 *  - SDSC byte addressing: CMD17/18/24/25 args are byte offsets (block*512);
 *    the card presents SDSC (CMD58 CCS=0) and translates `arg >> 9` -> block.
 *  - the write data phase (token 0xFE/0xFC + 512 bytes + CRC) is captured.
 *
 * Command set (what SD.h / SdFat / ESP-IDF sdspi actually use):
 *   CMD0 GO_IDLE (R1=0x01), CMD8 SEND_IF_COND (R7), CMD9 CSD, CMD10 CID,
 *   CMD12 STOP_TRANSMISSION, CMD13 STATUS (R2), CMD16 SET_BLOCKLEN,
 *   CMD17/18 read single/multiple, CMD24/25 write single/multiple,
 *   CMD55+ACMD41 init (leaves idle), ACMD13, ACMD51 SEND_SCR (IDF reads the
 *   SCR on every SD card; SD.h never does), CMD58 READ_OCR (R3, CCS=0),
 *   CMD59 CRC_ON_OFF (real CRC16-CCITT on data blocks when enabled - the
 *   ESP-IDF sdspi host validates it; Arduino SD.h leaves CRC off).
 *
 * Bus interface: the bus fabric's `SpiDevice`, through {@link sdSpiFabricDevice}.
 * The fabric is what decides the card is selected: it hands the model only the
 * frames clocked while the card's own chip select is active and calls
 * select()/deselect() on its edges. No router keyed on CS sits in front of the
 * bridges' byte path, and so there is no always-selected fallback to make a
 * card with an unwired CS swallow the whole bus and blank the board's panel.
 *
 * `setCs()` stays as the model's own gate, driven by the fabric's select /
 * deselect: letting go of CS ends the transaction, which a real card does too.
 *
 * On a board whose CPU runs in a QEMU worker this model answers nobody: the
 * worker reads MISO synchronously and cannot wait for the tab. There the card
 * is the portable model in the bus map ({@link sdCardRemoteModel}), and this
 * copy only follows the MOSI the worker relays back, which is what keeps the
 * card panel showing what the guest wrote.
