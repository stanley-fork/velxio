/**
 * An I2C part on the bus fabric (project board-buses-2026-09, F5).
 *
 * A part is on an I2C bus because its SDA and SCL are wired to one, not
 * because it was handed a simulator: it registers once with its own pin names,
 * and the fabric puts it on the bus of its SDA net, keeps it there across every
 * reset of the SoC, moves it when a wire moves, and takes it off by identity.
 * That is what ends the three ways registration by address went wrong:
 *
 *   - a device handed to the simulator went on the board's bus 0, so a part on
 *     Wire1 (or on the XIAO RP2040, whose Wire is I2C1) never answered, and a
 *     part wired to nothing answered anyway;
 *   - removal by address took off whichever device held that address,
 *     the part's replacement included;
 *   - the worker record of a QEMU board was keyed by 200 + address, so two
 *     parts at one address were one record, and deleting one deleted both.
 *
 * The part keeps its register model in the `I2CDevice` shape it always had;
 * this module adapts it to the fabric's target contract.

/**
 * A register-file part as a bus target.
 *
 * The bus only calls a target for traffic addressed to it, so the ACK of the
 * address phase is "present". What a register-file model needs to hear is the
 * START that turns a transaction around: its first written byte is a register
 * pointer, and it tracks that with a flag it clears in stop(). A repeated START
 * for writing, with no STOP before it, starts a new pointer write on the bench
 * (M5Unified reads the BMI270's id twice that way), so the flag is cleared
 * there too. Only then: a stop() per transaction is also what repaints a
 * display, and doing it on every START would paint each frame twice.
 *
 * A model that has to know where a read begins hears every START itself
 * (`start`): the MPU-6050 answers a burst from the sample it latched there.
 * One that does something between two transactions is handed the clock of
 * the board it was placed on (`setClock`).
