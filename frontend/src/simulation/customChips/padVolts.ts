/**
 * The voltage on a chip's pad, as the circuit solve publishes it.

 * `vx_pin_read_analog` answers this in every host, and this is the one place
 * the number comes from: the browser runtime reads it straight from the
 * electrical store, and the tab's copy of a chip that runs elsewhere (a QEMU
 * worker, the host beside a Linux guest) publishes the same numbers to that
 * host as `pad_volts`, keyed by the chip's own pin names, once when it ships
 * the chip and again whenever the solve moves one of them. The two hosts
 * therefore agree by construction (finding
 * vx-pin-read-analog-answers-neither-host-the-solve).
 *
 * A pad is WIRED when the diagram puts it on a net: NetlistBuilder keys the
 * pin-to-net map by every wire endpoint, so a pad nobody drew a wire to is
 * absent from it and reads as in the air. A model whose UI control stands in
 * for a missing wire (the Grove ADS1115's sliders) asks `vx_pin_wired` and
 * uses the control only then.
