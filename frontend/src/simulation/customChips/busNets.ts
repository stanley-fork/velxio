/**
 * Multi-driver bus net registry — Phase 1 of the multi-chip digital bus track
 * (project/multichip-bus/). Sits between the chip runtime and the PinManager
 * for chip-to-chip BUS net keys (syntheticNetPin), and, since board-buses F7,
 * for the board pins a chip drives.
 *
 * Phase 0 gave every endpoint of a chip-to-chip net one shared PinManager key,
 * but PinManager is last-writer-wins — wrong for a bus where several chips can
 * drive one data line and the rest release it (Hi-Z). This registry tracks each
 * chip pin's (value, strength) contribution per net, resolves the net with the
 * 4-valued rules (busLogic.resolveNet), and pushes the RESOLVED level into the
 * PinManager so readers see the bus, not the last writer. Contention (two strong
 * drivers disagree -> X) is surfaced as a console warning, like Proteus.
 *
 * A board pin is a net like any other, with one more driver on it: the MCU's
 * pad. What the guest does to the pad is on the PinManager's pad channel
 * (driving low, driving high, or released with a pull), so the resolution
 * here is the wired-AND every open-drain line relies on: a chip that pulls
 * the pin low wins over the pull-up, and a chip that goes back to VX_INPUT
 * stops contributing, and the pull restores the level. The resolved level
 * goes to the PinManager and, through the sink the chip host registers,
 * into the guest's input register. It used to be that a chip wrote the
 * PinManager and the guest straight from vx_pin_write, and its release wrote
 * nothing at all, so the board read the chip's last level forever (finding
 * chip-release-to-input-keeps-board-pin-driven).
 *
 * A module's own resistor on a line (the 10k pull-ups of a Grove 4-Digit
 * Display on CLK and DIO, the 4.7k of a DS18B20 module) is one more driver of
 * the board pin, of PULL strength, that stays on the net for as long as the
 * part is on the canvas (setBoardPinPull). The resolution is in tiers, as the
 * wire does it: any strong drive (the MCU's output, a chip pulling low, a
 * part's injection) decides the level; with none, the module's pull does,
 * and it beats the MCU's internal pull the other way because the smaller
 * resistor sets the divider (an external 4.7k-10k against the 20k-100k of a
 * pad); with neither, the pad's own pull. A released line on a module with a
 * pull-up therefore reads HIGH in the guest and on the level channel, which
 * is what every open-drain driver that releases with pinMode(INPUT) relies on
 * (avishorp's TM1637Display, finding module-pullup-not-modelled).
 *
 * Single-chip-to-component synthetic pins keep the legacy direct PinManager
 * path untouched.
