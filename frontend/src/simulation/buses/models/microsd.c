/*
 * microsd.c: the portable microSD card, SD-over-SPI, on the velxio-chip.h ABI.
 *
 * ONE model, every host. F4 of board-buses-2026-09 moves anything that drives
 * MISO next to the CPU that reads it, because QEMU asks for a byte
 * synchronously and cannot wait for the browser. The same compiled artifact is
 * therefore run by ChipRuntime.ts in the tab (local engines and the sinks),
 * by WasmChipRuntime in the ESP32 / STM32 worker, and by the Linux-board host.
 * It replaces three hand-kept twins that had already drifted apart:
 *
 *   frontend/src/simulation/parts/ProtocolParts.ts   microsd-card (JS)
 *   pro/frontend/src/pro/esp32sim/SdSpiCard.ts       the JS engines' slot (TS)
 *   backend/app/services/esp32_sd_slave.py           the QEMU worker (Python)
 *
 * What the drift cost is written into the code below: only the TS twin had
 * ACMD51 (without it no ESP-IDF app could mount), only the Python twin tracked
 * the idle bit, and the Python twin answers R1 one byte EARLY, where IDF's
 * fixed sdspi_hw_cmd_t layout cannot see it. This model is the union, so no
 * host is the odd one out.
 *
 * ── The card IS the blob ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The image arrives as the named blob "card" (vx_blob_* in velxio-chip.h) and
 * the guest's writes go straight back into it, which is how the SD panel in
 * the editor sees the file a sketch just wrote. A blob never grows, so the
 * card's capacity is the blob's size rounded down to whole sectors: addressing
 * past the last sector fails the way it does on real silicon instead of
 * quietly making the card bigger. No blob at all means no card in the slot,
 * and the model then never drives MISO.
 *
 * ── Two facts this project paid for; do not rediscover them ──────────────
 *
 * 1. R1 needs its N_CR fill byte IN FRONT of it. The SD spec allows 1 to 8
 *    byte times between a command and its answer, and real cards take at least
 *    one. SdFat (the SD.h of arduino-pico) throws that byte away before it
 *    starts polling, so with no fill at all it threw R1 away and no Pico
 *    sketch could mount a card. ESP-IDF is the other half of the same fact: it
 *    does not poll, `sdspi_hw_cmd_t` is a fixed layout whose r1 field is at
 *    offset 7, and `shift_cmd_response` only scans forward from there. One
 *    fill byte puts R1 exactly at offset 7 and satisfies both.
 *
 * 2. The card has to answer through the PEEK path as well as the transfer
 *    path. A bit-banged master reads MISO bit by bit and asks for the byte
 *    before the one it is clocking in has arrived. Here that is free: the
 *    answer already sits in the one-byte buffer handed to vx_spi_start, which
 *    is exactly what the host's peek reads.
 *
 * ── Why the model stays armed even while deselected ──────────────────────
 *
 * Every host clocks a device only while its chip select is active, so an armed
 * buffer is invisible until then. Keeping it armed means a host that cannot
 * deliver chip-select EDGES to a chip (the worker reaches a chip through its
 * pin map, which a wiring path may not fill in) still exchanges bytes
 * correctly; the edges are used for one thing only, ending the frame, which is
 * all a real card forgets when the host lets go of the bus.

   *   host stop a read ANY time, the transfer ending after the command's end
   *   bit. No driver this project runs does. Each reads a block to its last
   *   CRC byte and sends CMD12 on the very next byte:
   *     ESP-IDF 5.5 sdspi_host.c start_command_read_blocks: the last block is
   *       received with receive_extra_bytes = 2, the CRC only (line 821), then
   *       STOP_TRANSMISSION (line 865);
   *     SdFat 2.3.0 SdSpiCard.cpp readData clocks both CRC bytes even with
   *       CRC off (lines 385-393), and readStop / syncDevice send CMD12 only
   *       between readData calls;
   *     arduino-esp32 3.3.10 sd_diskio.cpp sdReadBytes ends on transfer16 of
   *       the CRC (line 222), then sdReadSectors sends STOP_TRANSMISSION
   *       (line 289);
   *     MicroPython's sdcard.py readinto clocks the two CRC bytes before
   *       releasing the card, and readblocks sends cmd(12) after the loop.
   *   Arduino SD.h (Sd2Card, AVR and RP2040) never issues CMD18 at all.
   *
   * So the byte right after a CRC is the one place a stop arrives. The card
   * hands out the next block's start token ALONE there (at_edge), and the
   * rest of the block (payload and CRC) in one run once the host has clocked
   * the token as data. A command that started on the token gets its remaining
   * bytes answered one command at a time, so CMD12 is heard on its sixth byte
   * and R1b lands at offset 7, as before. That is two calls into this module
   * per streamed sector where there were 515.
   *
   * What this gives up, said here rather than left to be found: a host that
   * sent CMD12 in the MIDDLE of a payload would get its R1b after the block's
   * CRC instead of 7 bytes after the command, and a polling host would read
   * payload bytes as R1. The spec permits that host; none of the drivers
   * above is one. */
