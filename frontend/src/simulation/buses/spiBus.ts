/**
 * One SPI bus = one SCK net on one board (DESIGN section 6.1).
 *
 * A hardware controller whose SCK is routed to that net delivers its frames
 * here; a software (bit-banged) master on the same net delivers them through
 * the soft decoder. Either way the arbitration is the wire's:
 *
 *   - a device only ever sees frames clocked while its chip select is active;
 *   - MISO is the answer of the one selected device that drives it, or the
 *     line's idle level when none does;
 *   - two drivers at once is contention (AND, plus a diagnostic), exactly the
 *     garbage a real board reads back.
 *
 * The selected set is maintained on chip-select EDGES, never looked up per
 * frame, so the per-frame cost is one call to the selected device.
