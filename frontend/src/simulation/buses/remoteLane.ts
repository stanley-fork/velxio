/**
 * One board's remote SPI lane (project board-buses-2026-09, F4).
 *
 * It owns the two halves a QEMU board needs and nothing else does: the
 * controller port the worker's bytes arrive on, and the bus map that tells the
 * worker who is on the bus and how each one is selected.
 *
 * The port is created ONCE per board and kept: a device is on this board's bus
 * because its pins are on the controller's nets, and that must survive every
 * rebuild of the bridge behind it (D-003). The map is pushed again whenever
 * membership changes, because that is the only moment the worker's answer can
 * become wrong.
