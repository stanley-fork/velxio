/**
 * BusRegistry: every bus device of the project, and the fabric of every board.
 *
 * A device registers ONCE with its pins named on its own component. The
 * registry walks the nets to find the board and pins each device lands on,
 * puts it on the bus of its SCK net, and keeps its chip select up to date. It
 * recomputes membership when the circuit changes, so editing a wire moves the
 * device between buses without anyone re-attaching, and it re-watches chip
 * selects when a board's engine is bound again. Nothing depends on the order
 * devices registered in.
 *
 * I2C targets live in the same registry with the same rules: registered once
 * by their own pin names, placed on the bus of their SDA net, moved when the
 * circuit changes, removed by the identity of their handle. One more: an SDA
 * net that reaches two boards (their I2C pins wired to each other) puts the
 * target on both boards' buses, so either master finds it, as on the bench.
 *
 * UART endpoints too, with one difference that is the protocol's: a UART has
 * no bus, so each LEG is placed on its own. The RX leg lands on the net of
 * the board pin it reaches and the TX leg on the net of its own, each with
 * whatever controller is routed there; a leg that reaches no board pin is on
 * no wire. Nothing here picks a UART for a part (no boards[0], no default
 * unit): the wire decides, or the guest's clock does on a plain GPIO.
