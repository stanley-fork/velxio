 * Bus fabric contracts (project board-buses-2026-09, DESIGN sections 3 and 4).

 *  - a CONTROLLER PORT is the engine's face: one per serial peripheral of the
 *    SoC, created once per board and re-bound by its adapter whenever the
 *    engine rebuilds the SoC (reset, Stop/Run, firmware reload, engine swap);
 *  - a DEVICE is anything that talks on a bus: canvas parts, the board's own
 *    peripherals, custom chips, the software-bus decoders;
 *  - the FABRIC sits between them, decides membership from the circuit's nets
 *    and arbitrates like the wire does (chip select, address, line).
 *
 * Nothing here knows a simulator object. A device never touches an engine
 * hook, and an engine never sees a device, so neither can depend on the order
 * the other one attached in.
