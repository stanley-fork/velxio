/**
 * PiBridgeShim — the simulator-shaped object a Linux-guest board (the
 * Raspberry Pi family and any overlay-registered kind of the same family)
 * hands to the parts wired to it.
 *
 * Why it exists: every part on the canvas attaches to
 * `getBoardSimulator(boardId)` and asks it for a pin (`setPinState`,
 * `pinManager`) or an ADC (`setAdcVoltage`), and its bus lines reach the
 * board through the bus fabric's ports below. A Pi had no entry in that
 * map: a hand-rolled stub in DynamicComponent answered `setPinState` and
 * nothing else, so an I2C sensor wired to GPIO2/3 attached nowhere and the
 * guest read 0x00 from an address that had a model sitting right there on
 * the canvas. This class gives the Pi the same surface the STM32 and ESP32
 * shims give their boards, over the same `PinManager` every other board uses.
 *
 * Two engines run a Pi script, and both come here for their peripherals:
 *
 *   - the Linux guest in QEMU (via `RaspberryPi3Bridge`): the guest's shim
 *     libraries send one request line per bus operation and the backend
 *     relays it to the browser as `pi_bus_request {rid, line}`; the store
 *     wires `bridge.onBusRequest` to {@link answerBusLine} and the bridge
 *     sends the answer back as `pi_bus_reply`;
 *   - an in-browser engine, which calls {@link answerBusLine} directly with
 *     the same lines.
 *
 * One grammar, one answerer, the same device models: whatever a sensor
 * answers in one engine it answers in the other, by construction.
 *
 * Request lines (one per operation; `<addr>`, `<reg>` and byte strings in hex):
 *
 *   I2C <bus> <addr> R  <n>              raw read of n bytes
 *   I2C <bus> <addr> W  <hex>            raw write
 *   I2C <bus> <addr> RR <reg> <n>        write reg, repeated start, read n
 *   I2C <bus> <addr> WR <reg> <hex>      write reg + bytes
 *   I2C <bus> <addr> T  <hex|-> <n>      write bytes, repeated start, read n
 *   I2C ... #<seq>                       the same line, its write numbered by the relay
 *   SPI <bus> <cs> X  <hex>              full-duplex transfer, CS released after
 *   SPI <bus> <cs> XC <hex>              same, CS held low for the next transfer
 *   SPI <bus> <cs> W | WC <hex>          X / XC with nothing waiting for MISO
 *   SPI <bus> <cs> CONFIG <hz> <mode> <bits>   the handle's settings, nothing to answer
 *   W1 <pin> LIST | SP <rom> | RES <rom> <bits>
 *   W1 <pin> RESET | RB | WB <hex> | RBLK <n> | WBLK <hex> | TRIPLET <d>
 *   PWM <ch> <period_ns> <duty_ns> <en>  hardware PWM channel (0 = GPIO18, 1 = GPIO19)
 *   PWM_START | PWM_CHANGE <pin> <hz> <duty_pct>, PWM_STOP <pin>
 *   GPIO_SETUP <pin> <in|out> [<pud_up|pud_down|pud_off>]
 *
 * Replies:
 *
 *   I2C_DATA <bus> <addr> [<hex>]        ack; the bytes read, if any
 *   I2C_ERR  <bus> <addr> nack           nobody acknowledged the address
 *   I2C_ERR  <bus> <addr> nack data      the address was, a data byte was not
 *   SPI_DATA <bus> <cs> <hex>            the bytes clocked in on MISO
 *   W1_LIST  <pin> [<rom>,...]           ROM ids on that pin
 *   W1_SLAVE <pin> <rom> <18hex> <crc_ok>  a slave's 9-byte scratchpad
 *   W1_DATA  <pin> <hex|0|1|ok>          the byte-level ops
 *   W1_ERR   <pin> no-master             nothing registered on that pin
 *   (null)                               lines that need no answer (PWM, GPIO_SETUP, CONFIG)
 *
 * SPI (project board-buses-2026-09): the board's two header controllers are
 * bus-fabric ports ({@link getBusBinding}), one per controller and created
 * with the shim, so a guest reboot, Stop/Run or a switch between the two
 * engines changes who clocks the bytes and never the port. The CE lines are
 * the controller's own chip selects, reported to the fabric as such. The
 * fabric is the only SPI path: a part is on this bus because its pins are on
 * the controller's nets, never because it hooked a callback here.
 *
 * I2C (F5) has the same shape: I2C0 and I2C1 are ports, a request line's
 * `<bus>` picks the port, and the fabric answers from the targets whose SDA is
 * on that controller's net. The backend relay is told which addresses exist on
 * which bus from the same placement ({@link busTopology}).
 *
 * UART (F6) too: the header UART (UART0, the PL011 behind /dev/serial0) is one
 * port on GPIO14/15. What the board transmits reaches it from either engine
 * (the guest through `RaspberryPi3Bridge.onUartTxBytes`, the in-browser one
 * through {@link headerUartTx}) and the fabric hands it to every part whose RX
 * is wired to GPIO14; what such a part answers enters the port and goes to
 * whichever engine is running ({@link sendSerialBytes}). Until F6 the board's
 * outgoing bytes bypassed the parts entirely (velxio #358): a module that only
 * speaks when spoken to never heard the question.
