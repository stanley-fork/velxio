/**
 * I2C Bus Manager: the I2C controller port of the engines whose master is an
 * avr8js AVRTWI or an rp2040js RPI2C (project board-buses-2026-09, F5).
 *
 * One manager per hardware controller, created with the simulator and kept
 * across every rebuild of the SoC (`attachMaster` re-points it at the new
 * peripheral), so the fabric's transaction handler installed once keeps
 * hearing the controller after a reset, a Stop/Run or a firmware reload.
 * Every START, byte and STOP the controller puts on the wire reaches that
 * handler exactly once, and what the handler answers (the ACK of an address
 * or a byte, the byte a target drives) is what the peripheral completes with.
 *
 * Everything that answers lives on the bus fabric (simulation/buses): a chip
 * is on this controller's bus because its SDA and SCL are on the nets the
 * controller is routed to, on this board or wired over from another one. The
 * manager holds no devices of its own: a device registered here by address
 * sat on this board's first bus whatever its wires reached, one part's cleanup
 * could evict another at the same address, and a peer board's devices needed
 * a bridge graph of their own. The `I2CDevice` shape below stays as the
 * register-file model the parts keep, adapted to the fabric by
 * parts/i2cPart.ts.

 *    0x80000.
 *  - Forced mode is one measurement, and the chip is back in sleep mode when
 *    it is done (3.6.2). A conversion takes no time here, so the mode bits
 *    read 00 at once and the measurement is what the panel said at the write.
 *    esp-idf-lib and M5Unit-ENV wait for those bits, BMP280_DEV starts the
 *    next conversion only from sleep mode.
 *  - In normal mode the chip measures by itself (3.6.3): a read finds what
 *    the panel says when it begins, and the whole burst is answered from that
 *    one measurement (3.10), so a slider moving while it is read cannot mix
 *    two of them.
 *  - `measuring` reads 1 once after a mode write that starts a conversion.
 *    SparkFun's and pocketBME280's examples wait for it to rise with no
 *    timeout, Adafruit's takeForcedMeasurement() waits for it to fall.
 *    Without a clock the cycles of normal mode that follow are not seen in
 *    status.
 *  - A write is pairs of register address and register data, and the address
 *    does not count up (5.2.1, figure 7). A read counts up from the last
 *    address written (5.2.2).
 *  - What the panel sets is the world around the chip, not a register: it
 *    survives a soft reset.
 *
 * The calibration parameters are the BMP280 datasheet example values (Section 8.2).
 * They produce T ≈ 25°C, P ≈ 1006 hPa from the corresponding raw ADC values.
 *
 * Setting `temperature` (°C) and `pressure` (hPa) properties recomputes the
 * raw ADC values using a binary search over the Bosch compensation formulas so that
 * Arduino sketches using the Adafruit_BMP280 / Bosch driver get realistic values.

 * Virtual DS3231: the temperature-compensated clock with two alarms, at 0x68.

 *    oscillator runs whatever EOSC says (Control Register, bit 7).
 *  - CONTROL powers on at 0x1C. RTClib's setAlarm1() and setAlarm2() refuse
 *    to arm an alarm unless INTCN reads 1, and CONV is gone by the next read
 *    (Makuna's Rtc polls it after forcing a conversion).
 *  - STATUS powers on with OSF clear (DS3231_RULES.power_on says why), so
 *    RTClib's lostPower() is false. OSF, A1F and A2F can only be written
 *    to 0.
 *  - A1F and A2F are set when the clock counts through a second the alarm's
 *    registers match, whether or not the interrupt is enabled, and stay until
 *    the sketch writes them to 0 (RTClib alarmFired, clearAlarm). The INT/SQW
 *    pin is not driven.
 *  - The temperature is the panel's, in quarter degrees, two's complement:
 *    q = round(T x 4), 0x11 = q >> 2, 0x12 = (q & 3) << 6. It is read only.
