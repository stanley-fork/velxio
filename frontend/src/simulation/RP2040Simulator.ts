 * RP2040Simulator — Emulates Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) using rp2040js
 *
 * Features:
 * - ARM Cortex-M0+ dual-core Cortex-M0+ CPU at 125 MHz (single-core emulated)
 * - 30 GPIO pins (GPIO0-GPIO29)  xc fv       nn
 * - 2× UART, 2× SPI, 2× I2C
 * - ADC on GPIO26-GPIO29 (A0-A3) + internal temp sensor (ch4)
 * - PWM on any GPIO
 * - LED_BUILTIN on GPIO25
 * - Full bootrom B1 for proper boot sequence
 *
 * Arduino-pico pin mapping (Earle Philhower's core):
 *   D0  = GPIO0   … D29 = GPIO29
 *   A0  = GPIO26  … A3  = GPIO29
 *   LED_BUILTIN = GPIO25
 *   Default Serial  → UART0 (GPIO0=TX, GPIO1=RX)
 *   Default I2C     → I2C0  (GPIO4=SDA, GPIO5=SCL)
 *   Default SPI     → SPI0  (GPIO16=MISO, GPIO19=MOSI, GPIO18=SCK, GPIO17=CS)

// per second of wall-clock would otherwise run the simulation in slow motion:
// a `delay(1000)` blink renders every 4-5 s.  Two mechanisms keep sim-time
// locked to wall-time:
//   1. The frame budget is derived from the MEASURED wall-clock delta (like
//      AVRSimulator), not a fixed 1/60 s, so the sim never silently falls
//      behind the assumed 60 fps.
//   2. A `delay()` busy-wait spins reading the timer without putting the core
//      to sleep (no WFI), so the WFI fast-path never triggers and the emulator
//      grinds every idle cycle.  IdleSpinDetector recognises such a
//      side-effect-free spin and we advance the clock over it instead of
//      executing it — exactly what the WFI path already does for sleep().
