/**
 * serialWire — the seam where the host's serial TERMINAL meets the board's UART.
 *
 * A serial monitor is not a window into the sketch: it is a second device on a wire,
 * and it only reads what the board sent if both ends agree on the line settings. Set
 * the terminal to 9600 while the sketch talks at 115200 and a real monitor prints
 * garbage — that is the single most common first-day mistake in embedded teaching, and
 * a simulator that silently "fixes" it teaches the wrong lesson.
 *
 * So the board publishes the line it is actually clocking (`setBoardSerialLink`, fed by
 * the AVR USART's UBRR and by the ESP32 engines' decoded CLKDIV/CLK_CONF), and a model
 * installed here gets to decide what the terminal at the other end makes of those bytes.
 * Nothing in OSS installs one, so the default is the identity: bytes through unchanged.
 * The pro overlay installs a bit-level 8N1 receiver (sample at mid-bit on the RECEIVER's
 * clock, resync on the next start edge) which reproduces the real garbage, in both
 * directions — typing into a mismatched terminal corrupts what the board receives too.
 *
 * Applied per flush of the serial batcher, i.e. per burst of bytes: a burst is clocked
 * back to back, and the line idles between bursts, which is how a `Serial.println` in a
 * loop reaches the pins. Bytes from a REAL board (Web Serial hardware monitor) have
 * already crossed a real wire at a rate the user picked, so the model leaves them alone.
