/**
 * useElectricalStore — Zustand slice for the WASM-ngspice mixed-mode
 * simulator's published results.
 *
 * SPICE runs through `CircuitSimulationService` (see
 * `simulation/spice/CircuitSimulationService.ts`).  The service calls
 * `setSolveResult()` after each solve to publish an atomic snapshot
 * into this store, which the 12 downstream consumers (LED handler,
 * Voltmeter, Ammeter, AnalogOverlay, ADC bridge, etc.) read.
 *
 * The store no longer owns the solver — it's a pure state container.
 * Pause is a UI control that stops re-solves on switch / property
 * changes (the engine still holds the last result so LEDs stay lit).
