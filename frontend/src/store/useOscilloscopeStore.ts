 * Oscilloscope / Logic Analyzer store.

 * Captures pin HIGH/LOW transitions with microsecond-level timestamps
 * derived from the CPU cycle counter and renders them as waveforms.
 *
 * Channels are keyed by (boardId, pin) so multiple boards with the same
 * logical pin number can be monitored independently.
 *
 * Trigger model — matches a real digital storage scope:
 *
 *   - `auto`   free-running display; the window's right edge tracks the
 *              latest sample.  This is the default and the behaviour
 *              existing test suites depend on.
 *
 *   - `normal` window pins around each triggering edge: the trigger
 *              event lands at `triggerPosition * windowMs` from the
 *              left, with the rest of the window showing post-trigger
 *              samples.  The window holds steady until the next edge.
 *
 *   - `single` arms once: on the first triggering edge after arming the
 *              scope captures, then sets `running = false` so the trace
 *              freezes for inspection.  User must click "Single" again
 *              to re-arm.
 *
 * Edge detection looks at the configured trigger channel only.  The
 * trigger fires when the newly-pushed sample's state differs from the
 * previous one on that channel AND the transition matches the configured
 * `triggerEdge` (rising / falling / either).
