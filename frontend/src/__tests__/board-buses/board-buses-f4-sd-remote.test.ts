/**
 * The microSD card on a board whose CPU is not in this tab (project
 * board-buses-2026-09, F4).
 *
 * The card used to exist three times: the state machine inside this part, the
 * pro overlay's SdSpiCard for a board's own slot, and a third in Python that
 * the QEMU worker was handed the image for (`esp32_sd_slave.py`). They had
 * drifted, and each drift was a card that mounted on one engine and not
 * another. F4 leaves two things: ONE JavaScript card in this tab, which is
 * what the SD panel lists, and ONE portable model, which is what answers the
 * guest wherever the guest runs.
 *
 * This suite is about the second one: that the card the user put on the canvas
 * reaches the worker as that model, carrying what is actually on it. The
 * artifact is the REAL committed one, read off disk, so a rebuild that changes
 * the bytes is seen here too.
