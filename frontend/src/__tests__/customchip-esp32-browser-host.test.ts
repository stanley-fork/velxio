/**
 * A custom chip on an ESP32 board whose bridge does not host chips in a
 * backend worker takes the browser path: GPIO through the shim, and its
 * buses (UART included) through the fabric by its own pads.
 *
 * The OSS QEMU bridge hosts chips in its worker and has no opinion; an
 * overlay's in-browser engine answers `hostsCustomChips()` false. Before
 * this seam existed the shim's `sendPinEvent` alone decided, and a chip on
 * an in-browser engine was shipped as a sensor record nothing ever ran.
 *
 * SPI is no longer one of the surfaces: a chip joins a board's SPI bus from
 * its own vx_spi_attach and the fabric routes it by its wiring, so nothing is
 * installed on the shim for it. What used to be tested here (the chain node
 * this module hung on `simulator.spi`) is gone with it; the byte path of a
 * chip on a real engine is covered by
 * board-buses/board-buses-repro-chips-spi.test.ts.
