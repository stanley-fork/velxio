/**
 * editorCommands — a tiny id → handler registry for the editor menu bar.
 *
 * The actions the File/Edit menus expose (save, open, export, reset the
 * canvas view…) already exist, but they live inside the closures of four
 * different components: EditorPage owns save/new, FileExplorer owns open,
 * EditorToolbar owns import/export, SimulatorCanvas owns the view. A menu
 * mounted in the app header can reach none of them by props without
 * threading callbacks through the whole page tree.
 *
 * So the owners register their handler under a stable id on mount (and
 * unregister on unmount), and the menu invokes by id — the same
 * registration-seam pattern the codebase already uses for pro examples,
 * guest setups and board builtins. A menu item whose command is not
 * currently registered renders disabled, which is also the truth: with no
 * canvas mounted there is nothing to reset.
