/**
 * Intellisense registry.
 *
 * Seam between the OSS editor and the pro overlay's code-completion engine
 * (the private `velxio-intellisense` package). OSS ships no completion
 * engine of its own, so without an overlay this registry is inert and the
 * editor behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * Two-sided handshake, because arrival order is not guaranteed:
 *
 *   - CodeEditor's `beforeMount` calls `attachIntellisenseMonaco(monaco)`
 *     every time an editor instance is created (which happens on every
 *     file switch — the editor is keyed by file id).
 *   - The overlay calls `installIntellisenseImpl(impl)` from `mountPro()`,
 *     which lands via an async `import('@pro/index')` and may resolve
 *     before or after the first editor mounted.
 *
 * Whichever side arrives last triggers the install. The impl itself is
 * responsible for being idempotent per monaco instance (the package guards
 * with a WeakSet), so replaying it on every mount is safe and cheap.
